"This study develops an integrated framework, termed the GAI&amp;ABC model, to examine how manufacturing firms can leverage generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to achieve sustainable business model innovation (SBMI) in production systems. While prior research primarily focuses on the technical aspects of AI, we address the challenge of understanding the organisational learning mechanisms that underpin GAI's impact on SBMI. Drawing on the Antecedents-Behaviour-Consequences (ABC) model, we investigate the mediating roles of GAI-powered exploitative and exploratory learning, and consider international entrepreneurship orientation and GAI education as key moderators. Using survey data from 402 manufacturing start-ups in China and employing PLS-SEM analysis, we find that GAI adoption significantly enhances both exploitative learning (β = 0.439, p &lt; 0.001) and exploratory learning (β = 0.444, p &lt; 0.001), which in turn drive SBMI (β = 0.254 and β = 0.353, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, fsQCA reveals four distinct configurations of these factors that lead to high SBMI performance, highlighting the complexity of GAI implementation. This study contributes a novel theoretical framework that integrates GAI adoption with organisational learning and contextual factors to explain SBMI in production systems, offering actionable insights for firms and addressing the challenge of translating GAI's potential into tangible sustainability outcomes.","Wang, Shaofeng; Zhang, Hao",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/00207543.2025.2485318,kp66msknfb,,,18,International Journal of Production Research,,6757,6732,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=kp66msknfb&recordId=kp66msknfb&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250915,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Organizational learning; Business models; Flexible manufacturing systems; Manufacturing industries; China; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Learning by discovery; Machine learning,Leveraging generative artificial intelligence for sustainable business model innovation in production systems.,63
"The use of generative AI (genAI) in consumer research is rapidly evolving, with applications including synthetic data generation, data analysis, and more. However, their role in creative ideation—a cornerstone of consumer research— remains underexplored. Drawing on the human creativity literature, we propose that ideation with genAI is facilitated by its productivity and semantic breadth, which are psychologically analogous to the dual pathways of persistence and flexibility in human ideation. Further, we distinguish between the utility of genAI as a key ideator versus humans as key ideator, conceptualized through the genAI ideation roles of Designer and Writer and of Interviewer and Actor. While genAI excels in generating incremental improvements, its potential for groundbreaking innovation could be unlocked by leveraging its ability to prompt human creativity. This article advances the theoretical and practical understanding of genAI in ideation for consumer research, offering numerous practical guidelines for integrating generative AI into research while emphasizing human–AI collaboration to achieve radical insights.","Freitas, Julian De; Nave, Gideon; Puntoni, Stefano",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1093/jcr/ucaf012,twe2fmolb5,,,1,Journal of Consumer Research,,31,18,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=twe2fmolb5&recordId=twe2fmolb5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Oxford University Press / USA,Consumer research; Production (Economic theory); Idea (Philosophy); <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models; Creative ability; Human-<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> interaction; Semantics,Ideation with Generative AI—in Consumer Research and Beyond.,52
"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represents a watershed moment in the evolution of digital platforms. The capabilities of this AI technology go beyond traditional AI systems, enabling the autonomous generation of novel outcomes with significant implications for platform value creation, architecture, governance, and stakeholder interactions. We develop an integrative conceptual framework that identifies four key mechanisms through which GenAI transforms digital platforms: intelligent automation, democratization, hyper-personalization, and collaborative innovation. Through intelligent automation, GenAI transforms boundary resources from passive interfaces into active, intelligent mediators of value creation. Democratization systematically lowers barriers to platform participation. Hyper-personalization enables dynamic, individual-level adaptation of platform content. Collaborative innovation transforms platform innovation by making GenAI an active participant in human-AI value co-creation. We use this framework to situate the papers in the special issue and develop a research agenda that explores the transformative impact of GenAI on platform stakeholder relationships.","Wessel, Michael; Adam, Martin; Benlian, Alexander; Majchrzak, Ann; Thies, Ferdinand",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487315,n7hrc4sanf,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,369,346,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=n7hrc4sanf&recordId=n7hrc4sanf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Value creation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models; Digital technology,Generative AI and its Transformative Value for Digital Platforms.,42
"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has introduced new possibilities for both the creation and analysis of language, which is one key input for consumer culture researchers who analyze qualitative and textual data. How can consumer culture researchers use GenAI to produce insights and work with qualitative data? What are the possibilities and challenges of using these tools? And what are some valuable practices and principles for integrating GenAI into the research process? Building from interviews with researchers who use these tools, the authors identify relevant theoretical, embodied, empirical, and historical contextual dimensions that produce opportunities and challenges for human–AI collaboration.

"Compared to traditional digital technologies, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) exhibits two facets—open-endedness and inscrutability—that create challenges for the value co-creation of complementors in GenAI platform ecosystems. For example, complementors lack standardized, reusable functionality that powers their applications and struggle to consistently generate desired outputs. To identify how complementors mitigate these challenges, we conducted an embedded case study of complementors in the OpenAI platform ecosystem. We identified four value co-creation mechanisms of embedded and stand-alone complements that mitigate the challenges: (1) utilizing system instructions, (2) providing context data, (3) curating user inputs, and (4) revising AI model outputs. Depending on the complement type, complementors employ these mechanisms, leverage synergies between mechanisms, and unlock previously not employable mechanisms. We contribute to research by revealing two novel logics—the reap logic and the differentiation logic—that explain how complementors co-create value by mitigating the challenges through the value co-creation mechanisms.","Heimburg, Vincent; Schreieck, Maximilian; Wiesche, Manuel",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487310,pyb32jbbjz,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,528,491,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=pyb32jbbjz&recordId=pyb32jbbjz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Customer cocreation; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Value creation; Marketing Consulting Services; Marketing Research and Public Opinion Polling; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models,Complementor Value Co-Creation in Generative AI Platform Ecosystems.,42
"Digital platforms facilitate interactions among geographically distributed users which reinforce the positive network effects. However, a disproportionate increase in the contributions of users results in contribution pollution (disproportionate increase in users' contributions) and information cacophony (incoherence of contributions). Unaddressed, contribution pollution and information cacophony challenges have negative implications for platform efficiency and users' humanistic outcomes. This paper highlights the limitations of existing mechanisms and proposes a framework for a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)–based recommender system. To evaluate the efficacy of the GenAI–based recommender system, we develop an agent-based simulation model and conduct experiments using real data from three platforms (Reddit, Hacker News, and Stack Overflow). This research contributes a novel sociotechnical framework that addresses the challenges of contribution pollution and information cacophony. For the governance of platforms, this research provides actionable guidance on the policy implications of integrating GenAI-based technologies for user- and platform-level outcomes.","Malgonde, Onkar S.",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487311,dlomzcrj5v,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,490,457,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=dlomzcrj5v&recordId=dlomzcrj5v&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Recommender systems; Information networks; Pollution; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Digital technology,Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)-Based Recommender Addressing Contribution Pollution and Information Cacophony on Digital Platforms.,42
"Generative AI (GenAI) may fundamentally reshape how users seek knowledge in online knowledge sharing communities. Although prior work found an overall decrease in knowledge seeking in online communities upon the availability of GenAI, the underlying dynamics across user groups have remained unexplored. This study addresses that gap. Drawing on commitment-based theory, we hypothesize that casual users—motivated by cost-benefit considerations—are more likely to reduce their question-posting activity than highly committed members. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that ChatGPT's arrival leads to a substantial drop in questions on StackExchange, primarily driven by casual users (about 18.2%). Motivated by information foraging theory, we reveal heterogeneous downstream effects of GenAI on question characteristics. In particular, we find that the questions by casual users become more complex and novel, while those by intensive and top users do not. These results highlight the importance of heterogeneous user motivations in shaping platform dynamics, underscoring that while GenAI may diminish overall participation, it may also increase the value of the remaining content. Our study offers insights for knowledge sharing communities, managers, and stakeholders reliant on user-generated data, providing a nuanced view of GenAI's disruptive influence.","Quinn, Martin; Gutt, Dominik",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487313,66zjegq6hj,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,399,370,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=66zjegq6hj&recordId=66zjegq6hj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Information theory; Information sharing; Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Theory of knowledge; ChatGPT; Virtual communities,Heterogeneous Effects of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on Knowledge Seeking in Online Communities.,42
"This essay in honor of ASQ 's 70th volume surveys how technology-driven changes in scholarly publishing have introduced algorithmic management to organizational research. The internet greatly reduced the cost of publishing journals and prompted an orders-of-magnitude increase in the number of journals and articles while also foregrounding quantitative metrics for scholarship. Given the academic incentive system of publish or perish, the new online ecosystem has encouraged problematic practices by scholars and publishers that threaten the standards and values of organizational theory. The advent of generative artificial intelligence within this milieu is almost certain to worsen the publishing trends we have already experienced. Drawing on prior literature about the centrality of deep intellectual engagement through reading, writing, and interactions with colleagues, we propose a set of reforms to preserve the sacredness of craft and community at the core of our scholarly work.","Bechky, Beth A.; Davis, Gerald F.",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/00018392241304403,ozaeuwiezj,,,1,Administrative Science Quarterly,,22,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=ozaeuwiezj&recordId=ozaeuwiezj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250301,Administrative Science Quarterly,Organizational research; Technological innovations; Book Publishers; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Scholarly publishing; Bibliometrics; Philosophy of science,Resisting the Algorithmic Management of Science: Craft and Community After Generative AI.,70
"While digital platform vendors are rapidly offering new generative artificial intelligence products (GAIPs), prior research on algorithmic aversion suggests that users may not respond to them the same way as to the human-generated products (HGPs). We propose that GAIPs induce psychological value, defined as a user's intrinsic desire for a product that can influence their willingness to pay and may depend on the product type. Disclosing a product as a GAIP or HGP could further influence user reactions. From our randomized experiments with three different products representing functional, hybrid, and creative product types, we find psychological value plays an important role in creative products, such as wall art. Human disclosure shows no effect on functional or highly creative products. Our study theoretically extends the algorithmic aversion literature by illustrating the role of psychological value in GAIP highlighting the nuanced role of product type and disclosure in influencing user reactions and offering practical implications.","Sikhondze, Bachazile; Ye, Hua Jonathan; Wang, Weiyu; Zhan, Xinhui; Santhanam, Radhika",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487314,2wvkvdd4b5,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,456,431,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=2wvkvdd4b5&recordId=2wvkvdd4b5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Willingness to pay; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Street art; Digital technology; Aversion,Are You Willing to Pay for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Products?

"Digital platforms are increasingly integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools as a boundary resource to enhance the quantity and quality of content with the ultimate goal of improving platform viability. As GenAI tools hold unique characteristics compared to traditional boundary resources, platform owners need to adapt their governance mechanisms accordingly. To understand how platform governance evolves over time in response to this novel boundary resource, we draw on the distributed tuning framework and build on insights from an in-depth qualitative study of a digital content platform in the educational sector. We find that the platform owner deployed different logics of GenAI integration over time that were enacted through specific governance mechanisms. The shift in logics and respective governance mechanisms was triggered by a dialectic process of resistance and accommodation between platform actors. In this process, the GenAI-enabled boundary resource not only changed over time but also served as a means for the power dynamics between platform owner and complementors to be reshaped. Our study contributes to both the platform governance literature as well as recent debates around GenAI.","Mayer, Anne-Sophie; Kostis, Angelos; Strich, Franz; Holmström, Jonny",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487312,d3zhhmlgpv,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,430,400,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=d3zhhmlgpv&recordId=d3zhhmlgpv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Power (Social sciences); Logic; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Digital technology; Dialectic,Shifting Dynamics: How Generative AI as a Boundary Resource Reshapes Digital Platform Governance.,42
"Teachers’ instructional decisions rely on effective data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers flexible and efficient support for these processes. However, few studies have explored its practical application in classroom decision-making. This study aimed to develop a generative AI chatbot to enhance teachers’ data literacy (DL) and data-informed decision-making (DIDM). Using Richey and Klein’s design and development research methodology, this study was conducted in four phases: analysis, design, development, and evaluation. The chatbot was reviewed by five experts and pilot-tested by four participants before being tested in an experiment. A single group pre-post paired samples t-test was conducted with 25 teachers, who interacted with the chatbot on Zoom once a week for 2 weeks. Teachers’ reflective journals were examined using open coding procedures to analyze their responses. The findings revealed a significant increase in teachers’ DL and DIDM efficacy. A qualitative analysis of the teachers’ reflective journals highlighted the chatbot’s strengths, limitations, and potential improvements. Based on these findings, this study offers practical implications for developing and using generative AI chatbots to support school teachers’ DIDM processes.","Lee, Jiwon; Lee, Jeongmin",JSTOR Journals,,,ddi7twzuw5,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,317,298,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=ddi7twzuw5&recordId=bxmxejfcbr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Generative AI chatbot for teachers’ data-informed decision-making : Effects and insights,28
"The emergence of Generative AI technologies, represented by ChatGPT, has triggered extensive discussions among scholars in the education sector. While relevant research continues to grow, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding that systematically measures the effects of Generative AI on student learning outcomes. This study employs meta-analysis to integrate findings from previous experimental and quasi-experimental research to evaluate the impact of Generative AI on student learning outcomes. The analysis of 44 effect sizes from 21 independent studies indicates that Generative AI tools, compared to traditional AI tools or no intervention, moderately enhance student learning outcomes ( g = 0.572). These tools significantly improve the cognitive ( g = 0.604), behavioral ( g = 0.698), and affective ( g = 0.478) dimensions of learning outcomes. In addition, the study identifies and examines 6 potential moderating variables: educational level, sample size, subject area, teaching model, intervention duration, and assessment instrument. The results of the moderating effects test reveal that sample size and assessment instrument significantly influence the effectiveness of Generative AI. For sample size, the effect of Generative AI on small samples ( g = 1.216) is greater than that on medium ( g = 0.476) and large samples ( g = 0.547). For assessment instrument, the effect of Generative AI on self-developed tests ( g = 0.984) is greater than that on standardized tests ( g = 0.557). The meta-analysis result indicated that the use of Generative AI should be supplemented with detailed guidance and flexible strategies. Specific recommendations for future research and practical implementations of Generative AI in education are discussed.","Hu, De-Xin; Pang, Dan-Dan; Xing, Zhe",JSTOR Journals,,,eaf6cdzfon,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,240,226,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=eaf6cdzfon&recordId=rmo65ntrgb&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Evaluating the effects of Generative AI on student learning outcomes : Insights from a meta-analysis,28
"Previous studies have demonstrated that summarization activities effectively enhance students’ reading comprehension and learning performance. With the ongoing surge in the application of artificial intelligence in education, this study introduces a chatbot with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to assist students in reviewing Python programming concepts by refining the summary after class. Consequently, this study aims to assess the efficacy of the proposed a GenAI-enabled chatbot in enhancing the summarization ability and learning performance of novice programmers in college. Experimental results reveal that, the GenAI-enabled chatbot not only significantly improves students’ programming coding performance but also significantly improves their summarization ability. It is noteworthy that students’ summarization proficiency is not only elevated from the outset but also consistently progresses until the end. This study also identified that understanding the Python programming concepts of input/output operations and lists serves as predictors for learning performance in programming concept and coding, respectively. This emphasizes the significance of fundamental programming concept and a nuanced understanding of advanced data types in programming learning.","Huang, Anna Y.

"ChatGPT, which rides on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has garnered exponential attention worldwide since its release in 2022. While there is an increasing number of studies probing into the potential benefits and challenges of ChatGPT in education, most of them confine the focus to informal learning and higher education. The formal adoption of ChatGPT in authentic classroom settings, especially in K-12 contexts, remains underexplored. In view of this gap, we conducted a quasi-experiment to study the effects of integrating ChatGPT into a compulsory Grade-10 English as a foreign language (EFL) writing course in a Hong Kong secondary school. The participants (99 Grade-10 students) were divided into treatment or control groups; the former and latter respectively used ChatGPT and conventional media as the tool for EFL writing instruction. The analysis of the participants’ EFL writing performance at the end of the experiment shows that the treatment group outperformed the control group. Further, there was a significant interaction effect between the assigned group of participants and their baseline level of EFL proficiency. Compared to the high-achieving participants, low-achieving ones tended to benefit more from ChatGPT-supported EFL writing instruction in the experiment. These findings together suggest that ChatGPT has the potential to be applied in formal EFL writing instruction in K-12 classroom settings.","Pei, Leisi; Jong, Morris Siu-Yung; Huang, Biyun; Pang, Wai-Chung; Shang, Junjie",JSTOR Journals,,,7lnubspiuf,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,297,281,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7lnubspiuf&recordId=5446jp46db&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Formally integrating Generative AI into secondary education : Application of ChatGPT in EFL writing instruction,28
"Language teachers mostly spend much time scoring students’ writing and may sometimes hesitate to provide reliable scores since essay scoring is time-consuming. In this regard, AI-based Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems have been used and Generative AI (GenAI) has recently appeared with its potential in scoring essays. Therefore, this study aims to focus on the differences and relationships between human raters (HR) and GenAI scores for the essays produced by English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. The data consisted of 210 essays produced by 35 undergraduate students. Two HR and GenAI evaluated the essays using an analytical rubric divided into the following five factors: (1) ideas, (2) organization and coherence, (3) support, (4) style, and (5) mechanics. This study found that there were significant differences between the scores given by HR and those generated by GenAI, as well as variations among the HR themselves; nonetheless, GenAI’s scores were similar across dual evaluations. It was also noted that GenAI’s scores were statistically significantly lower than those of HR. On the other side, it was found that HR scores correlated weakly, while GenAI scores correlated strongly. A significant correlation was observed between HR-1 and GenAI across all factors, whereas the second HR-2 showed significant correlations with GenAI in only three factors. Therefore, this study can guide EFL teachers on how to reduce their workload in writing assessments by giving GenAI more responsibility in scoring essays. The study also offers many suggestions for future studies on AES based on the findings and limitations of the study.","Topuz, Arif Cem; Yıldız, Mine; Taşlıbeyaz, Elif; Polat, Hamza; Kurşun, Engin",JSTOR Journals,,,mmozmdabav,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,50,36,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=mmozmdabav&recordId=jzhfcwvfdn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Is generative AI ready to replace human raters in scoring EFL writing?

"With the wide application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology in society, GenAI literacy and critical thinking are considered vital competencies for success in the future. As future teachers, pre-service teachers (PSTs) must possess these key competencies. Previous research has pointed out that although learning and applying GenAI knowledge and technology can improve PSTs’ GenAI literacy, the results were not as expected. This study incorporated a KWL (Know, Want, Learned)-based reflection strategy based on the SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer) model, and proposed an RSCQA (Reflection, Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer) approach, which aims to help PSTs develop GenAI literacy and critical thinking. A quasi-experiment was designed for this study to verify the validity of the RSCQA approach, which was used by the experimental group, while the Conventional SCQA (CSCQA) approach was used by the control group. Results of the study demonstrated that using the RSCQA approach improved PSTs’ GenAI literacy and critical thinking, and they excelled in multimodal demonstration capability. This study also conducted an ENA analysis of the content of PSTs’ reflections, and the results demonstrated that reflective strategies help PSTs engage in higher-order cognitive activities. The results of the qualitative interviews further indicated that the reflective strategy enhanced PSTs’ learning effectiveness and strengthened their critical thinking. Overall, the RSCQA approach helps PSTs engage in reflective learning and perform better in GenAI literacy and critical thinking.

"Although image-generative AI (GAI) has sparked heated discussion among engineers and designers, its role in CAD (computer-aided design) education, particularly during the conceptual design phase, remains not sufficiently explored. To address this, we examined the integration of GAI into the early stages of design in a CAD class. Specifically, we conducted an in-class workshop introducing Midjourney for conceptual design and released a home assignment on mood board design for hands-on GAI design practice. Twenty students completed the workshop and assignment from a CAD class at a research-intensive university. We collected and analyzed data from surveys, students’ prompts, and design artifacts to explore their perceptions of GAI, prompt behaviors, and design creativity and conducted a correlation analysis between these variables. After the workshop, students significantly rated GAI as more useful and user-friendly in design and found it more supportive in terms of design efficiency and aesthetics, while we did not find a significant difference in design creativity. By analyzing 365 prompts used for completing home tasks, we identified three types of prompt behaviors: generation, modification, and selection, as well as classified three types of workflows: exploration, two-step, and multi-step. The correlation analysis showed that design creativity changes significantly and positively correlated with their prompt behaviors. Students with more multi-step prompts produced more creative artifacts based on the instructors’ evaluation. This exploratory study offered valuable insights into the integration of GAI in CAD education and suggested potential directions for future GAI curricula and tools in design education.","Zhu, Wangda; Xing, Wanli; Kim, Eddy Man; Li, Chenglu; Wang, Yuanzhi; Yang, Yoon; Liu, Zifeng",JSTOR Journals,,,rdoiu2vnnr,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,183,166,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=rdoiu2vnnr&recordId=xrjr4hehpf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,"Integrating image-generative AI into conceptual design in computer-aided design education : Exploring student perceptions, prompt behaviors, and artifact creativity",28
"Discussing with generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has been recognized as a method for obtaining information. Researchers have noticed that students’ ability to search, select, and evaluate information (e.g., their online information-searching strategies) may affect the quality of their learning and discussion with GAI. In this study, we conducted an experiment in an online science course to explore the role of online information-searching strategies (OISS) in the process of students discussing with GAI. A total of 46 high school students participated in the study. In the course, students wrote question prompts to the GAI, accessed information provided by the GAI, and composed their science reports. We collected the students’ OISS tendency questionnaire, science reports, and the question prompt content they wrote to GAI. According to the results, students with higher OISS outperformed those with lower OISS in terms of content accuracy and logical descriptions in their science reports. The ordered network analysis (ONA) results showed a significant difference in the prompting sequences of the two groups of students. Students with higher OISS gradually developed their knowledge models of scientific concepts by organizing information and finding connections or inconsistencies among different types of knowledge. Students with lower OISS strategies focused more on content extension and consolidation of independent expertise. We labeled the higher OISS students as holism learners, while the lower OISS students were labeled as atomism learners. Lastly, the study findings underscore the importance of guiding students to comprehensively structure and synthesize their knowledge within GAI-based learning environments.","Lai, Chiu-Lin",JSTOR Journals,,,gihuxkgpkz,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,262,241,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=gihuxkgpkz&recordId=ld6l777xub&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Consolidate knowledge or build scientific models?

"The rapid development of chatbots undergirded by large language models calls for teachers and students to explore using chatbots in educational ways. Given this new phenomenon, education researchers need to explore students’ responses to chatbots to comprehensively understand their experiences. This study adopted purposive sampling to interview Taiwanese university students ( N = 17) who had used ChatGPT for a semester in an open elective course. Transcripts were analyzed using the grounded theory approach. Findings indicate that while the challenges posed by ChatGPT perturbed the students, their actual interactions with the chatbot revealed that it lacks some vital epistemic aspects. ChatGPT cannot discern what is true, and cannot experience the world as humans do. Hence, while it could assist humans in some epistemic endeavors, the students concluded that they need to assume epistemic agency in its use. The findings imply that educators may need to design academic tasks that further develop undergraduates’ epistemic agency for the critical and creative use of chatbot-generated artifacts.","Tian, Ting; Chai, Ching Sing; Chen, Mei-Hwa; Liang, Jyh-Chong",JSTOR Journals,,,j5vihnvrdf,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,165,151,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=j5vihnvrdf&recordId=ztlxy6awwr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,University students’ perceptions of learning with generative artificial intelligence,28

"Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT have found prominence in recent times with their ability to generate texts, images, etc. Several questions pertaining to ethical and legal issues surrounding ChatGPT have arisen. In this paper, I discuss the nature and background of generative AI, situating its development in the historical context of AI. I then discuss my primary research questions: is sufficient attention paid in the literature on ethics of AI to the principle of beneficence and is there theoretical clarity on its meaning? I highlight that while there is great deal of discussion on what harms can arise from generative AI and how to stop them, there is very little discussion on what amounts to AI-for-good, particularly in the literature of AI ethics and regulation. To the extent that such discussion exists, it pushes ahead with suggesting specific solutions, without fully addressing the underlying question of what makes their prescriptions beneficent. I demonstrate that the principle of beneficence as understood in biomedical ethics and human rights frameworks has limited utility for the ethics of generative AI. These gaps in the AI regulation are prominent, as they can derail long term progress of generative AI and the realization of its full potential.","Singh Chauhan, Krishna Deo",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/13600869.2024.2364989,hj2jqtegc5,,,2,"International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology",,174,152,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=hj2jqtegc5&recordId=hj2jqtegc5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,"<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology); <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Bioethics; ChatGPT; Research questions",ChatGPT for good?

"A key stumbling block in effective supply chain risk management for companies and policymakers is a lack of visibility on interdependent supply network relationships. Relationship prediction, also called link prediction is an emergent area of supply chain surveillance research that aims to increase the visibility of supply chains using data-driven techniques. Existing methods have been successful for predicting relationships but struggle to extract the context in which these relationships are embedded – such as the products being supplied or locations they are supplied from. Lack of context prevents practitioners from distinguishing transactional relations from established supply chain relations, hindering accurate estimations of risk. In this work, we develop a new Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) enhanced machine learning framework that leverages pre-trained language models as embedding models combined with machine learning models to predict supply chain relationships within knowledge graphs. By integrating Generative AI techniques, our approach captures the nuanced semantic relationships between entities, thereby improving supply chain visibility and facilitating more precise risk management. Using data from a real case study, we show that GenAI-enhanced link prediction surpasses all benchmarks, and demonstrate how GenAI models can be explored and effectively used in supply chain risk management.","Zheng, Ge; Brintrup, Alexandra",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/00207543.2025.2543964,4pmx4l3obj,,,,International Journal of Production Research,,23,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=4pmx4l3obj&recordId=4pmx4l3obj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250812,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,,Enhancing supply chain visibility with generative AI: an exploratory case study on relationship prediction in knowledge graphs.,

"This study investigates the short-term impact of generative AI, exemplified by the introduction of ChatGPT, on user contributions in a coding Q&amp;A platform. We find that the introduction of ChatGPT led to a reduction in the number of high-quality answers provided by users, particularly among highly engaged contributors, despite an overall increase in answers. We identify two key mechanisms: (1) increased perceived question sophistication despite no actual change in content and (2) reduced motivation of loyal users in providing answers in the face of AI-generated alternatives. The findings suggest that while generative AI can facilitate value creation on user-generated content (UGC) platforms, it also poses challenges in retaining core contributors and managing content quality. The paper contributes to the literature on the impact of AI adoption on platforms and suggests practical implications for UGC platform management, such as the need for AI content disclosure measures to retain engaged users.","Li, Xinyu; Kim, Keongtae",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1007/s11002-024-09747-1,onayklj53f,,,3,Marketing Letters,,591,577,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=onayklj53f&recordId=onayklj53f&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250901,Springer Nature,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; User-generated content; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; ChatGPT; Question &amp; answer websites,Impacts of generative AI on user contributions: evidence from a coding Q &amp;A platform.,36
"Adoption of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) has stimulated interest in assessing how foundation-model competencies appear in current job advertisements across various fields and industries. This study investigates how Taiwanese job postings are integrating generative AI across distinct occupational families, focusing on the depth and nature of AI-related skill requirements. Drawing on a dataset of 628 postings, two complementary strategies are employed in order to assess both the prevalence and the specific skill sets associated with these technologies. The combination comprises frequency-based metric of AI references within each post and a targeted topic model isolating text specifically referencing generative AI. Results indicate that technologically oriented and creatively driven families, such as Computer and Mathematical and Arts, Design, Entertainment, demonstrate substantially higher mentions of foundation-model capabilities. In contrast, managerial and sales-centric roles tend to reference AI more sparingly. These findings suggest a widening skill gap in Taiwan's labor market, where requirements for AI proficiencies are particularly concentrated in fields already leveraging technical or creative expertise. The outcomes can guide university curricula, corporate training, and policy decisions aimed at cultivating relevant AI proficiencies across diverse occupational domains.","Granmo, Anders; Ming-Lang Yeh; Sheng-Hsun Hsu",Business Source Ultimate,,,46ubjdkfmz,,,1,International Journal of Organizational Innovation,,75,70,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=46ubjdkfmz&recordId=46ubjdkfmz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Frederick L.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly being integrated into marketing education and is reshaping the skill sets required in marketing careers. While research has highlighted the promise and perils of incorporating GAI into education, there remains a need for a comprehensive framework to guide its effective use. In this research, the authors conduct a multipronged analysis, including a review of marketing course syllabi, a survey of marketing educators, and follow-up qualitative interviews. Building on role theory and the community of inquiry model, they propose that GAI can assume three roles in marketing education: tutor, teammate, and tool. Each role influences teaching, social, and cognitive presence differently, shaping the learning experience and preparing workplace-ready marketing graduates. For instance, as a tutor, GAI can aid students in grasping theoretical concepts, while as a teammate, it can foster collaboration by supporting brainstorming and problem-solving activities. However, ethical considerations such as data privacy, plagiarism, dependency on AI, and fairness in assessment must be addressed to ensure its responsible adoption in marketing education. The authors provide concrete examples for GAI's careful integration in marketing courses and discuss its implications for marketing educators, learners, and policy makers.","Narang, Unnati; Sachdev, Vishal; Liu, Ruichun",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/07439156251328237,i5n2efo7m5,,,3,Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing,,489,473,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=i5n2efo7m5&recordId=i5n2efo7m5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,American Marketing Association,Business teachers; Marketing education; Community of inquiry; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Data privacy,When AI Wears Many Hats: The Role of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Marketing Education.,44

"The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools is a paradigm shift in enhanced learning methodologies and assessment techniques. This study explores the adoption of generative AI tools in higher education assessments by examining the perceptions of 353 students through a survey and 17 in-depth interviews. Anchored in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this study investigates the roles of perceived risk and tech-savviness in the use of AI tools. Perceived risk emerged as a significant deterrent, while trust and tech-savviness were pivotal in shaping student engagement with AI. Tech-savviness not only influenced adoption but also moderated the effect of performance expectancy on AI use. These insights extend UTAUT's application, highlighting the importance of considering perceived risks and individual proficiency with technology. The findings suggest educators and policymakers need to tailor AI integration strategies to accommodate students' personal characteristics and diverse needs, harnessing generative AI's opportunities and mitigating its challenges.","Oc, Yusuf; Gonsalves, Chahna; Quamina, La Toya",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/02734753241302459,4s7xf3hxzz,,,2,Journal of Marketing Education,,155,138,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=4s7xf3hxzz&recordId=4s7xf3hxzz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,Sage Publications Inc.,Technological literacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Higher education; Risk perception; Educational evaluation; Student engagement; Educational technology; Technology Acceptance Model,Generative AI in Higher Education Assessments: Examining Risk and Tech-Savviness on Student's Adoption.,47
"This theoretical study rigorously investigates how generative artificial intelligence reshapes decision-making in social entrepreneurship by modeling the opportunity search process through the lens of optimal stopping theory. Social entrepreneurs often face high uncertainty and resource constraints, requiring them to strategically balance the cost of continued searching with the chance of identifying socially impactful opportunities. This study develops a formal model that captures two core mechanisms of generative AI: reducing search costs and increasing the probability of mission-aligned opportunity success. The theoretical analysis yields three key findings. First, generative AI accelerates the optimal stopping point, allowing social entrepreneurs to act more quickly on high-potential opportunities by lowering cognitive and resource burdens. Second, the influence of increased success probability outweighs that of reduced search costs, underscoring the strategic importance of insight quality over efficiency in socially embedded contexts. Third, the benefits of generative AI are amplified in uncertain environments, where it helps navigate complexity and mitigate information asymmetry. These insights contribute to a deeper conceptual understanding of how intelligent technologies transform the cognitive and strategic dimensions of social entrepreneurship, and they offer empirically testable propositions for future research at the intersection of AI, innovation, and mission-driven opportunity pursuit.","Kim, Junic",Business Source Ultimate,,10.3390/admsci15080302,34bfrxrkrr,,,8,Administrative Sciences (2076-3387),,,302,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=34bfrxrkrr&recordId=34bfrxrkrr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,MDPI,Social entrepreneurship; Decision making; Information asymmetry; Technological innovations; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Cognitive load; Optimal stopping (Mathematical statistics),Modeling Generative AI and Social Entrepreneurial Searches: A Contextualized Optimal Stopping Approach.,15

"The emergence of generative AI (GenAI) has illustrated that higher education needs to adapt to the technology. Its speed of evolution requires that we adequately prepare students for an ever-changing landscape. Toward achieving that aim, we draw on the concept of interpretive flexibility, where the interpretations, uses, and outcomes of a new technology can differ and evolve over time, often with dominant stakeholders controlling the process. To engage marketing students in this process, we propose that they be presented with these diverse interpretations now as part of GenAI literacy. Specifically, we offer three small-scale pedagogical interventions designed to address this urgent need. Given the newness of GenAI, our interventions are designed to be infused into existing marketing instruction, instead of requiring a redesign of a curriculum. With each intervention, students not only significantly decrease their confidence in the accuracy of what GenAI produces but also see reasons to examine the implications of it. Both these outcomes, we suggest, could help to maintain interpretive flexibility required to properly respond to and guide the technology as its uses, impacts, and evolution become evident. We encourage educators to prioritize a comprehensive notion of GenAI literacy in their pedagogy to maintain interpretive flexibility.","Beninger, Stefanie; Reppel, Alex; Stanton, Julie; Watson, Forrest",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/02734753251316569,7hkgidk5yz,,,2,Journal of Marketing Education,,125,112,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7hkgidk5yz&recordId=7hkgidk5yz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,Sage Publications Inc.,Business teachers; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Higher education; Educational technology; Student engagement; Teaching methods,Facilitating Generative AI Literacy in the Face of Evolving Technology: Interventions in Marketing Classrooms.,47

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has sparked a lot of innovation in the servicescape to improve consumer experiences, primarily due to its ability to interact with consumers and personalize information based on the consumer's input. The authors develop a framework grounded in the social model of disability to propose how GenAI can be a tool to cocreate otherwise disabling servicescape information design. Consumers with disabilities can use this technology to modify, transform, prioritize, and generate servicescape information to fit their individual accessibility needs and mitigate disabling servicescape conditions, resulting in more positive servicescape experiences, better access, and inclusion. Institutions such as industry, government, and higher education play a dual role in this framework. While these institutions are responsible for creating servicescapes with disabling information design, they are also key collaborators that support consumers with disabilities in cocreating GenAI solutions and ensuring their effective and safe use.

"This tutorial discusses how large language models (LLMs) can transform data analytics instruction. It details innovative ways to blend AI into classes, from turning problem sets into AI tutoring sessions to crafting AI-driven group activities. This tutorial addresses the challenge of incorporating large language models, such as ChatGPT, in a data analytics class. It details several new in-class and out-of-class teaching techniques enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Here are three examples. Instructors can parallelize instruction by having students interact with different custom-made GPTs to learn different parts of an analysis and then teach each other what they learned from their GPTs. Instructors can turn problem sets into AI tutoring sessions: a custom-made GPT guides a student through the problems and the student uploads the chatlog for their homework submission. Instructors can assign different labs to each section of a class and have each section create AI assistants to help the other sections work through their labs.

"Natural disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires and cyclones, bear a huge risk on human lives as well as infrastructure assets. An effective response to disaster depends on the ability to rapidly and efficiently assess the intensity of damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents a breakthrough solution, capable of combining knowledge from multiple types and sources of data, simulating realistic scenarios of disaster, and identifying emerging trends at a speed previously unimaginable. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the prospects of AI and GenAI in damage assessment for various natural disasters, highlighting both its strengths and limitations. We talk about its application to multimodal data such as text, image, video, and audio, and also cover major issues of data privacy, security, and ethical use of the technology during crises. The paper also recognizes the threat of Generative AI misuse, in the form of dissemination of misinformation and for adversarial attacks. Finally, we outline avenues of future research, emphasizing the need for secure, reliable, and ethical Generative AI systems for disaster management in general. We believe that this work represents the first comprehensive survey of Gen-AI techniques being used in the field of Disaster Assessment and Response.","Raj, Aman; Shetgaonkar, Ankit; Arora, Lakshit; Pradhan, Dipen; Girija, Sanjay Surendranath; Kapoor, Shashank",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/COMPSAC65507.2025.00251,bnxpgwvp7b,,,,"2025 IEEE 49th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC), Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC), 2025 IEEE 49th Annual, COMPSAC",,1840,1834,,True,20250708,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Surveys; Ethics; Data privacy; Wildfires; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Disasters; Earthquakes; Disaster management; Cyclones; Fake news; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Disaster Response; Damage Assessment; Earthquake; Wildfire; Cyclone; Deep Learning; Data Privacy; Adversarial Attacks; Misinformation,AI and Generative AI Transforming Disaster Management: A Survey of Damage Assessment and Response Techniques,
"AbstractWith the start of generative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to create ads at scale, is the industry in danger of creating ineffective content efficiently, or AI can help achieve both efficiency and effectiveness? The adoption of generative AI in advertising is a function of not only efficiency but also effectiveness gains. This study looks beyond efficiency to consider consumer responses. It explores the productivity of AI-powered ads, in which generative AI tools assist in specific creative tasks under human supervision. This study introduces a new measure of &lt;italic&gt;artificial intelligence advertising productivity&lt;/italic&gt; (AAP). This measure employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) to examine the balance of generative AI advertising specific inputs to consumer response outputs. To understand consumer responses, this study uses topic modeling (BERTopic) and sentiment analysis (Google Natural Language AI) to analyze 10,378 consumer comments on the generative AI-powered ads and their comparable human-created ads. The results are fed into DEA to calculate AAP. The AAP measure provides marketers a suggested metric to evaluate the value gained from their AI advertising initiatives. It provides brands with a benchmark to assess their AI advertising performance against other brands. The results show a majority of generative AI-powered ads in the sample were identified as productive and consumers generally perceive these ads positive.","Yang, Jing",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/15252019.2025.2551598,zgo7ytfj2j,,,,Journal of Interactive Advertising,,18,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=zgo7ytfj2j&recordId=zgo7ytfj2j&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250908,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Advertising; Industrial productivity; Consumer behavior; Value (Economics); Sentiment analysis; Outdoor Advertising; Other Services Related to Advertising; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Data envelopment analysis,Exploring the Productivity of Generative AI-Powered Ad Campaigns: A Consumer Response Perspective.,
"AbstractAdvertising research widely uses visual stimuli. Stimuli development, whether by researchers or by hired designers, requires considerable time, funding, and know-how. Image generative artificial intelligence (iGenAI) allows faster and more cost-effective stimuli production, but whether this technology can produce rigorous experimental stimuli comparable to researcher-generated stimuli remains an open question addressed herein. First, we review publications in three advertising and marketing journals to identify relevant domains where iGenAI can be applied. Second, we present RAISE (&lt;italic&gt;R&lt;/italic&gt;apid &lt;italic&gt;A&lt;/italic&gt;rtificial &lt;italic&gt;I&lt;/italic&gt;ntelligence &lt;italic&gt;S&lt;/italic&gt;timuli for &lt;italic&gt;E&lt;/italic&gt;xperiments), a new methodology to generate AI stimuli, which requires no programming and relies on commercially available tools, increasing accessibility for researchers. Five studies (1,785 participants) directly compare visual stimuli generated using RAISE and iGenAI to stimuli generated by researchers and show that participants cannot differentiate them. Moreover, AI-generated stimuli satisfy the same manipulation checks in and replicate the effects of existing research. Three additional studies (&lt;italic&gt;N&lt;/italic&gt; = 368) lend additional robustness, indicating that iGenAI and RAISE are valuable tools to complement traditional methods for producing visual experimental stimuli in advertising research.","Zamudio, César; Grigsby, Jamie L.; Michelsen, Meg",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/00913367.2024.2438002,zmtoeimeif,,,,Journal of Advertising,,16,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=zmtoeimeif&recordId=zmtoeimeif&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20241220,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Visual perception; Manipulation checks (Research); Research personnel; Open-ended questions,RAISE: A New Method to Develop Experimental Stimuli for Advertising Research with Image Generative Artificial Intelligence.,
"Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are a strategic sector in the economy that requires continuous innovation in digital marketing strategies. As the need for attractive, professional, and easily accessible promotional content increases, generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology is a potential solution to support the efficiency and quality of visual design. This study explores how design thinking and generative AI can be used to create attractive and professional visual content. This study uses a design thinking method with seven stages including understand, observe, define point of view, ideate, prototype, test, and reflect. Each step uses specific tools such as persona profile canvas, feedback capture grids, and retrospective boards, as well as generative AI tools used in prototypes such as Canva AI, Prome AI, Leonardo AI and others to create faster and more optimal designs. The results of the study show that the use of AI in promotional materials significantly improves the efficiency and branding of MSMEs, enabling the production of high-quality content at a lower cost. However, challenges remain, related to the limited scope of the study which only focuses on one sector, namely Muslim fashion MSMEs and the lack of AI's ability to understand the nuances of brand identity in depth. This study contributes to increasing the understanding of the synergy between design thinking and generative AI, as it can provide practical guidance for MSMEs in optimizing digital marketing, and suggests future research that focuses more on assisting MSMEs directly in implementing AI in their businesses.","Indriani, Deta Nur; Kumalasari, Riesta Devi",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICoAILO66760.2025.11156061,rahi6lfikb,,,,"2025 IEEE International Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> for Learning and Optimization (ICoAILO), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> for Learning and Optimization, 2025 IEEE International Conference on (ICoAILO)",,351,345,,True,20250807,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Geoscience; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Visualization; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Brand management; Prototypes; Production; Reflection; Prompt engineering; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Business; micro small and medium enterprises; <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; design thinking; promotional materials",Integrating Generative AI with Design Thinking Approach to Improve Efficiency and Relevancy of MSMEs Promotional Content,
"The increasing prevalence of generative AI in education, exemplified by the multilingual ChatGPT (versions 3.5 and 4.0), necessitates a thorough evaluation of its performance across languages. Our research compared the accuracy of ChatGPT's English and Arabic responses to 39 chemistry problems from the 6th-7th grade level. While ChatGPT 4.0 showed notable improvements, particularly with Arabic, English responses remained more accurate. To bridge this gap, we recommend either enriching ChatGPT's Arabic knowledge base or adopting a translation protocol: process Arabic questions in English and then provide the translated answer to the user. This strategy aims to capitalize on the higher accuracy in English, potentially improving outcomes for Arabic speakers and others encountering similar linguistic limitations in AI-driven science education.","Daher, Wajeeh; Diab, Hussam; Rayan, Anwar",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SCME62582.2025.11104915,ekcq7teagn,,,,"2025 International Conference on Smart Learning Courses (SCME), Smart Learning Courses (SCME), 2025 International Conference on",,56,49,,True,20250709,IEEE,Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Chemistry; Accuracy; Translation; Protocols; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Knowledge based systems; Educational technology; Chatbots; Multilingual; Problem-solving; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; chemistry; problem solving; primary school; ChatGPT,Potential of Generative AI for Chemistry Problem Solving: Evaluating Effectiveness Across Different AI Model Generations and Linguistic Contexts,

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as large language models (LLMs), generate natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks. This represents a significant technological advancement that poses opportunities and challenges to educational research and practice. This commentary brings together contributions from nine experts working in the intersection of learning and technology and presents critical reflections on the opportunities, challenges, and implications related to GenAI technologies in the context of education. In the commentary, it is acknowledged that GenAI's capabilities can enhance some teaching and learning practices, such as learning design, regulation of learning, automated content, feedback, and assessment. Nevertheless, we also highlight its limitations, potential disruptions, ethical consequences, and potential misuses. The identified avenues for further research include the development of new insights into the roles human experts can play, strong and continuous evidence, human-centric design of technology, necessary policy, and support and competence mechanisms. Overall, we concur with the general skeptical optimism about the use of GenAI tools such as LLMs in education. Moreover, we highlight the danger of hastily adopting GenAI tools in education without deep consideration of the efficacy, ecosystem-level implications, ethics, and pedagogical soundness of such practices.","Giannakos, Michail; Azevedo, Roger; Brusilovsky, Peter; Cukurova, Mutlu; Dimitriadis, Yannis; Hernandez-Leo, Davinia; Järvelä, Sanna; Mavrikis, Manolis; Rienties, Bart",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/0144929X.2024.2394886,ars763jc6n,,,11,Behaviour &amp; Information Technology,,2544,2518,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=ars763jc6n&recordId=ars763jc6n&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,"Data security; Professional ethics; Computer software; Natural language processing; Professional competence; Computer, computer peripheral and pre-packaged software merchant wholesalers; Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers; Computer and software stores; Software publishers (except video game publishers); Computer systems design and related services (except video game design and development); Other Computer Related Services; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Learning; Educational tests &amp; measurements; Autodidacticism; Curriculum planning; Computer assisted instruction; Teacher-student relationships; Machine learning",The promise and challenges of generative AI in education.,44
"Although the growing use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in higher education research offers exciting potential for enhancing innovation and efficiency, it is also troubled by significant ethical challenges. This review systematically explores critical concerns that border on risks that are associated with data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency deficiencies, accountability gaps, and threats to academic integrity. This was done by providing a literature-based assessment of why the use GAI in higher education continues to be problematic. This assessment yielded informative insights that were deciphered from 31 papers which were systematically selected from a sampling universe of 119 publications. Findings highlight the necessity of striking a balance between embracing AI-driven advancements and upholding ethical standards in research, in a manner that does not compromise human capacities to mitigate the unexpected eventualities and their consequences. A set of actionable guidelines that are designed to enhance the responsible integration of GAI in higher education without side-lining the importance of observing critical ethical issues that must be considered and adhered to in academic research is given. These guidelines are useful because they form the foundation of a robust framework which guides the way GAI is used in higher education research without forgetting that this technology is not an all-round paragon.","Muchaku, Shadreck; Kabiti, Hlekani; Nthambeleni, Benard",Business Source Ultimate,,10.20525/ijrbs.v14i6.4080,fsxjxqsizj,,,6,International Journal of Research in Business &amp; Social Science,,336,329,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=fsxjxqsizj&recordId=fsxjxqsizj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,Center for Strategic Studies in Business &amp; Finance,Algorithmic bias; All Other Miscellaneous Schools and Instruction; Educational Support Services; Administration of Education Programs; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Higher education research; Data privacy; Education ethics,Integration of generative artificial intelligence into higher education research as a supporting tool: A balance between innovation and ethics in research.,14
"The advent of generative AI (GenAI) has caused consternation across the industrial landscape. The financial industry is no exception. The scramble to find GenAI solutions in the financial industry has led to a proliferation in the academic and practitioner literature on the subject. However, the field of knowledge remains scattered. The authors offer four deliverables. First, using a survey of the literature and interviews of managers in financial firms, they create a funnel-shaped, two-stage framework of how GenAI can empower financial businesses. The top stage comprises seven GenAI value propositions for financial firms, condensed into the EMPOWER acronym. The bottom stage includes three functions for each proposition. Second, the authors propose ten novel GenAI-based applications spanning the five verticals of financial services, thus extending the current industrial focus of GenAI applications. Third, they outline the benefits and risks of these GenAI applications, visualizing them in a benefit–risk matrix to assist financial managers in prioritizing these applications.

"The purpose of this study is to optimize the product design of existing VR devices by using generative AI with high development potential, and at the same time, to improve the usability of VR devices by remedying the weaknesses of current generative AI through collaborative design by designer. In this study, 30 students with interactive VR teaching needs were collected to experiment to analyze the usability of three types of VR devices: original, AI design, and AI + designer design handles. The participants were asked to operate the three VR devices, and after completing the tasks set in the experiment through the VR devices, the participants were asked to fill out the SUS scale to evaluate the usability. The results show that the usability of the AI + designer- designed devices is higher than that of the original and AI design devices, reaching statistical significance. This indicates that AI + designer design is one of the product design directions worth investigating in the future, which cannot only effectively utilize the advantages of AI's rapid proposal, but also compensate for the pain points of AI technology that cannot satisfy users' needs at this stage, and ultimately improve the effectiveness of product design.","Liang, Yo-Wen; Liu, Zih-Syuan",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/GEM66882.2025.11155695,356lbzcuwz,,,,"2025 IEEE Gaming, Entertainment, and Media Conference (GEM), Gaming, Entertainment, and Media Conference (GEM), 2025 IEEE",,5,1,,True,20250716,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas; Engineering Profession; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Nuclear Engineering; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Transportation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Pain; Education; Entertainment industry; Collaboration; Virtual reality; Media; Product design; Proposals; Usability; virtual reality; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; product design; usability",Using Generative AI to Develop Product Forms for Interactive Virtual Reality Educational Tools,
"The rise of digital platforms makes it increasingly challenging for developers to manage the growing number of user reviews. Replying to each review manually is time-consuming, and template responses often fail to deliver personalized and natural responses. With this challenge, we explore the use of generative AI models that can generate contextually appropriate and personalized responses by learning from data through fine-tuning. This allows for greater variety in responses, avoiding the repetition of static templates. In this study, we evaluated three lightweight and publicly available models: T5-small, FLAN-T5-small, and BART-base, for comparison. These models were chosen for their ability to achieve strong performance while being computationally efficient, which is particularly important when working with moderate-sized datasets. The dataset used consists of 10,000 review-response pairs scraped from Spotify and the Google Play Store and is split into training, validation, and test sets with an 80-10-10 ratio. Our results show that T5-small achieved the highest scores in automatic evaluation metrics, with a BLEU-1 score of 0.5095, a BLEU-4 score of 0.3344, and a ROUGE-L score of 0.4606. However, human evaluations revealed that BART-base outperformed the others in fluency, relevance, and accuracy, scoring 4.37, 3.73, and 4.03, respectively. FLAN-T5-small without instructions also performed well, while its performance with instructions was notably lower, highlighting the importance of prompt design in generative AI models. These findings underscore the challenges of deploying generative AI at scale and emphasize the importance of integrating automated metrics with human insights to generate contextually relevant and natural responses.","Hanestan, Fanes; Wulandhari, Lili Ayu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICoDSA67155.2025.11157547,yi4mzy3msn,,,,"2025 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA), Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA), 2025 International Conference on",,727,722,,True,20250703,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Measurement; Hands; Training; Accuracy; Reviews; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Oral communication; Data models; Reliability; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>ai</mark>; review response; text generation; evaluation; paraphrasing",Generative AI Models for Automated User Review Feedback on Digital Platforms,
"Generative AI is transforming digital creation by providing artists with tools that enhance efficiency and unlock new creative possibilities. In multimedia arts, including the growing digital art scene in the Philippines, AI-powered platforms are being used to accelerate workflows, automate tasks, and introduce innovative artistic techniques. While these advancements enable Filipino digital creators to experiment and increase productivity, they also raise concerns about originality, authenticity, and the diminishing value of traditional artistic skills. This study examines student perspectives on AI's impact using aspect-based sentiment analysis. The findings reveal that while students appreciate AI's accessibility and time-saving benefits, many remain cautious about its long-term influence on artistic growth. The Diffusion of Innovations Theory was applied to analyze AI adoption, highlighting both its advantages and challenges. Ethical concerns, such as copyright issues, fair attribution, and the potential devaluation of human-created art, continue to spark debate. These results emphasize the importance of an educational approach that integrates AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for human creativity. For Filipino digital creators, especially those in animation, graphic design, and content creation, it is crucial to balance AI's advantages with a strong foundation in artistic expression.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is an artificial intelligence (AI) technology that analyzes various data types to create original content, including written text, images, and sound. This study aims to identify the factors influencing employees' acceptance of generative artificial intelligence in the energy sector. A quantitative research method was used, and the research design adopted a screening approach. The data collection tool used in the study was the Generative Artificial Intelligence Acceptance Scale (GAI Acceptance Scale), whose validity and reliability were examined in Turkish by Yılmaz, Yılmaz, and Ceylan in 2023; the scale consists of two parts. The scale assessed GAI acceptance behaviors in terms of performance expectations, effort expectations, facilitating conditions, and social impact factors. The first part of the scale comprises seven questions for personal information, and the second part includes 20 items to assess the factors affecting participants' acceptance of generative artificial intelligence. The study group consists of 234 participants working in the energy sector. Data were collected between January 5 and 15, 2025. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on the data using the IBM SPSS 22 program. The new scale, consisting of three factors and 18 items derived from the EFA, was validated through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The LISREL 8.80 program was used for the CFA.

"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers the potential to enhance health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) by streamlining traditionally time-consuming and labour-intensive tasks, such as literature reviews, data extraction, and economic modelling. To effectively navigate this evolving landscape, health economists need a foundational understanding of how GenAI can complement their work. This primer aims to introduce health economists to the essentials of using GenAI tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), in HEOR projects. For health economists new to GenAI technologies, chatbot interfaces like ChatGPT offer an accessible way to explore the potential of LLMs. For more complex projects, knowledge of application programming interfaces (APIs), which provide scalability and integration capabilities, and prompt engineering strategies, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, is necessary to ensure accurate and efficient data analysis, enhance model performance, and tailor outputs to specific HEOR needs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can further improve LLM performance by incorporating current external information. LLMs have significant potential in many common HEOR tasks, such as summarising medical literature, extracting structured data, drafting report sections, generating statistical code, answering specific questions, and reviewing materials to enhance quality. However, health economists must also be aware of ongoing limitations and challenges, such as the propensity of LLMs to produce inaccurate information ('hallucinate'), security concerns, issues with reproducibility, and the risk of bias. Implementing LLMs in HEOR requires robust security protocols to handle sensitive data in compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the United States' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Deployment options such as local hosting, secure API use, or cloud-hosted open-source models offer varying levels of control and cost, each with unique trade-offs in security, accessibility, and technical demands. Reproducibility and transparency also pose unique challenges. To ensure the credibility of LLM-generated content, explicit declarations of the model version, prompting techniques, and benchmarks against established standards are recommended. Given the 'black box' nature of LLMs, a clear reporting structure is essential to maintain transparency and validate outputs, enabling stakeholders to assess the reliability and accuracy of LLM-generated HEOR analyses. The ethical implications of using artificial intelligence (AI) in HEOR, including LLMs, are complex and multifaceted, requiring careful assessment of each use case to determine the necessary level of ethical scrutiny and transparency. Health economists must balance the potential benefits of AI adoption against the risks of maintaining current practices, while also considering issues such as accountability, bias, intellectual property, and the broader impact on the healthcare system. As LLMs and AI technologies advance, their potential role in HEOR will become increasingly evident. Key areas of promise include creating dynamic, continuously updated HEOR materials, providing patients with more accessible information, and enhancing analytics for faster access to medicines. To maximise these benefits, health economists must understand and address challenges such as data ownership and bias. The coming years will be critical for establishing best practices for GenAI in HEOR. This primer encourages health economists to adopt GenAI responsibly, balancing innovation with scientific rigor and ethical integrity to improve healthcare insights and decision-making.","Reason, Tim; Klijn, Sven; Rawlinson, Will; Benbow, Emma; Langham, Julia; Teitsson, Siguroli; Johannesen, Kasper; Malcolm, Bill",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1007/s41669-025-00580-4,ix7bfziosb,,,4,PharmacoEconomics - Open,,517,501,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=ix7bfziosb&recordId=ix7bfziosb&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Springer Nature,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act; Language models; Hallucinations (<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>),Using Generative Artificial Intelligence in Health Economics and Outcomes Research: A Primer on Techniques and Breakthroughs.,9

"This study uses Generative Artificial Intelligence (gAI) to advance industrial digitization. Although the use of gAI looks promising for industrial digitization, there are significant gaps in current Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, which limit their applicability to such applications. By developing a theoretical framework, the aim is to provide explanations for gAI to improve decision-making processes with actionable insights and explanations for their intended outcomes. The proposed work has an impact on facilitating inspection, monitoring, optimization, and maintenance of industrial equipment and machinery. The theoretical framework proposed in this paper will address this challenge by following a three-step approach: 1) learning prior and posterior from data, 2) feature attribution and counterfactual explanation-based methods, and 3) integrated XAI.

"The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is reshaping engineering education. This study explores engineering students’ perceptions of the use of GAI tools to support their learning, focusing on three dimensions: 1) perceived ease of use and usefulness, 2) personalization, interactivity, and confidence, and 3) perceived intelligence and intention to adopt. A descriptive quantitative design was employed, involving 66 BSc and MSc engineering students from a Portuguese university who responded to a 49-item survey. The survey was designed ad hoc by the authors, drawing on recent instruments developed to assess higher education students’ perceptions of GAI use and adoption for learning (e.g., TAME-ChatGPT). Overall results show that students find GAI intuitive and beneficial for learning. However, they also recognize the importance of asking good questions and that these tools can dampen creativity and critical thinking. On the one hand, students are optimistic and inclined to adopt them; on the other hand, they voice ethical and reliability concerns (e.g., information credibility, over-reliance, plagiarism). These findings underscore the need for carefully designed, well-founded integration strategies that can both maximize the potential of GAI tools and minimize their pitfalls. Institutional guidelines, faculty professional development, and AI literacy training initiatives for students may play key roles in fostering the responsible and effective adoption of these tools in academic settings.","Dominguez, Caroline; Pessoa, Kaline Ligia; Morais, Ana; Cruz, Goncalo",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CISPEE64787.2025.11159184,4zrqajv755,,,,"2025 6th International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education (CISPEE), Portuguese Society for Engineering Education (CISPEE), 2025 6th International Conference of the",,6,1,,True,20250716,IEEE,Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Surveys; Hands; Training; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Plagiarism; Instruments; Focusing; Reliability; Engineering students; Guidelines; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; engineering education; student perceptions; technology adoption,"How Do Engineering Students View And Use Generative AI For Learning?

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered a progressive neurogenerative disorder that highly impacts elder people. Gradually this disease results in memory loss, poor thinking capacity, and overall cognitive decline. Nevertheless, various traditional works recommend that the pathological variations present in the brain happen decades prior to the initial clinical signs appearing. The implementation of cost-effective and noninvasive approaches to identify AD is significant for its timely mitigation as well as prevention. Therefore, in this article, an advanced generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided AD detection approach is designed using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are helpful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression very effectively. The EEG signals required for the identification of AD are collected from benchmark sources and are applied as the input to the ShortTerm Fourier Transform (STFT) for spectrogram image conversion. The AD detection is done using the proposed Attention-based Generative Adversarial Network (A-GAN), which produces the most desirable detection outcomes by classifying the input STFT images. The classification results are compared with the baseline AD detection approaches to validate the performance of the designed technique using various measures. The developed model supports earlier detection and provides highly more effective treatment interventions.","Ravikanti, Dileep Kumar; Saravanan, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICDICI66477.2025.11135201,ypdfft672b,,,,"2025 6th International Conference on Data <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Cognitive Informatics (ICDICI), Data <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Cognitive Informatics (ICDICI), 2025 6th International Conference on",,406,400,,True,20250709,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Pathology; Fourier transforms; Accuracy; Prevention and mitigation; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Brain modeling; Reliability engineering; Electroencephalography; Alzheimer's disease; Spectrogram; Alzheimer's Disease Detection; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Electroencephalogram Signals; Short-term Fourier Transform; Attention-based <mark>Generative</mark> Adversarial Network",Artificial Intelligence-Driven Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection Framework from EEG Signals Through Attention-Based Generative Adversarial Network,
"Deep learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has grown quickly and is now widely used in computer software. As the need for deep learning algorithms that can handle more complicated tasks keeps growing very quickly, the improvements in how efficient and productive these algorithms can be utilized for identifying data poisoning is an important step. Data poisoning refers to altering the legitimate data using various techniques and fabricating the expected results. The poisoning will affect the quality of predictions and reliability of the contents generated. The data sensitive applications which rely on classification models for deriving conclusions will be affected by poisoning resulting in unrealistic conclusions and misguided inferences. Continuous occurrence of poorly classified data and unrealistic conclusions will affect the reliability of the system making it less trustworthy. This research looks into long lasting effects of poisoning attacks, which target the training data used in deep learning and assess the way a deep learning model classifies information. Experiments were done to measure the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in effectively detecting poisoned data. The evaluations were done using KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression models. The analysis concludes that KNN offers better prediction compared to SVM and Logistic Regression. Logistic regression offers less accurate predictions making it unfit for poisoning detection. Proper classification of poisoned data will help research community and users to be aware of legitimacy of data and thereby help them to choose the right data and information for processing, analytics, and deriving conclusions. This will greatly improve the performance and trustworthiness of related models including generative AI systems and makes the learning process un biased which will highly benefit the research community in general.","Thomas, Priya; Asha, V.; Diman, Diksha; MB, Yashwanth; Pandey, Vishal; J, Arun",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICDICI66477.2025.11135090,ub22oyfnaz,,,,"2025 6th International Conference on Data <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Cognitive Informatics (ICDICI), Data <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Cognitive Informatics (ICDICI), 2025 6th International Conference on",,202,197,,True,20250709,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Deep learning; Logistic regression; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Soft sensors; Software algorithms; Training data; Nearest neighbor methods; Reliability; Random forests; Data Poisoning; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; un-biased learning; Intrusion Detection System (IDS); K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN); Random Forest",Safeguarding Creativity: The Impacts and Countermeasures of Data Poisoning in Generative AI Systems,

"Generative AI technologies have revolutionized animation production, yet their adherence to the foundational principles of animation remains underexplored. This study evaluates the extent to which AI-generated animations align with the ten fundamental principles defined by Thomas and Johnston. Five animations were systematically analyzed through expert evaluations and statistical methods, including inter-rater reliability, chi-square tests, factor analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and logistic regression. The results revealed that while principles such as Staging, Solid Drawing, and Appeal were consistently adhered to, dynamic motion-related principles like Squash and Stretch, Anticipation, and Exaggeration were entirely absent. For intermediate principles like Timing and Follow-Through were variable, it shows the constraints of AI's ability to reproduce temporal motion control. This research contributes to the animation field by providing an analysis of the animation principles in AI-generated animation, identifying both strengths and weaknesses. Practical significance highlights the potential for hybrid workflows wherein AI is employed for static composition tasks, and nuanced motion design is reserved for human animators. The results enable the development of generative artificial intelligence technologies, and the necessity for models capable of grasping the artistry and sophistication involved in conventional animation is now clear.

"Collective reflection is essential for pre-service science teachers' professional development which involves participants generating multiple ideas for their reflection exercises. However, current research revealed that it is a challenge for facilitating collective reflection due to its superficial cognition and intangible quality. Considering generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has been demonstrated to be able to help promote teachers' professional development in a large amount of existing research, this study integrated the ChatGPT 4.0 into preservice science teachers' collective reflection. Due to the dynamic and complicated process of collective reflection, Epistemic network analysis (ENA) approach was employed to trace the development process of 14 pre-service science teachers' collaborative discourse patterns in two collective reflection activities after micro-teaching and traditional classroom teaching.

"The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, has introduced various opportunities and challenges that must be addressed for its full potential to be realized in higher education. This study investigates the challenges associated with using GenAI tools in Omani higher education institutions (HEIs) from the perspective of both students and academics. Survey data was collected from 1,749 students and 450 academics across different universities in Oman. The main findings indicate that although both groups recognize issues like logical errors, bias and misleading information, lack of citation accuracy, facilitating cheating, dependency and reduced critical thinking, academics rated challenges slightly higher across all statements, especially on concerns about over-reliance on GenAI and concerns about facilitating cheating in exams or assignments. These findings indicate a significant concern among academics and students about over-reliance on GenAI, which may potentially diminish students’ ability to think critically and creatively, and increase students’ intellectual independence on ChatGPT. Despite these reservations on GenAI use, there is a general positive attitude of both students and academics for the adoption of GenAI in the higher education context, indicating a high level of readiness among both groups to explore GenAI's potential benefits, with an acknowledgment that regulatory frameworks may be necessary to address its potential drawbacks. The study highlights the need for regulatory frameworks, comprehensive guidelines and training programs to foster the responsible and ethical integration of GenAI technologies in Omani HEIs.","Alshamy, Alsaeed Saad; Al-Harthi, Aisha Salim Ali; Abdullah, Shubair",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SmartNets65254.2025.11106833,tsiy77cown,,,,"2025 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets), Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets), 2025 International Conference on",,5,1,,True,20250722,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Surveys; Ethics; Translation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Chatbots; Global communication; Cultural differences; Standards; Guidelines; Perceptions; Students; Academics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (GenAI); ChatGPT; challenges; Higher Education Institutions; Oman",Challenges of Using Generative AI Tools in Omani Higher Education Institutions :Perceptions of Students and Academics,

"Anatomy education often fails to engage learners or foster precise 3D spatial understanding of complex systems like the human skeleton. We present a Game-Based VR Anatomy Learning system with Generative AI, introduced as a Proof of Concept for our GenAiVR-Lab framework. This prototype validates the foundational pillars of our future development. In the Anatomy Lab scenario, 25 medical students explore a virtual skeleton and undertake a timed mission: assemble three bone fragments within two minutes. Incorrect picks are disabled with point deductions; learners may request a one-shot conversational hint from a ChatGPT-powered Virtual Anatomy Instructor; if time expires, a teammate continues with remaining time. We measured perception changes using pre- and post-test versions of four Perspective Questionnaires: Learning Perspective (LPQ), VR-AI Perspective (VRAIPQ), Generative AI Perspective (GAIPQ), and Game-Based Learning Perspective (GBLPQ). Results demonstrate significant improvements across all four perspectives, with mean scores increasing by approximately 1.3 points on the 5-point Likert scale and nearly all participants showing positive gains. Effect sizes ranged from 2.52 to 3.34, indicating large practical significance, with all measures reaching statistical significance. These findings demonstrate that collaborative game mechanics and generative AI guidance enhance engagement and spatial reasoning.

"Accurate and timely prediction of epileptic seizures is critical for effective clinical intervention in epilepsy management. Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely utilized to capture neural patterns indicative of seizure activity, but traditional machine learning approaches often struggle with limited, imbalanced, and noisy EEG data. This study proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework for EEG signal augmentation and seizure prediction using the UCI Epileptic Seizure Dataset. The approach focuses on improving classification performance by generating synthetic EEG data to balance class distribution and enhance model generalization. After preprocessing steps, redundant column removal and Z-score normalization, the GAN architecture autonomously learns feature distributions and augments the dataset with realistic samples. Experimental results show that the GAN-enhanced model achieves superior accuracy (98.23%) compared to conventional models, including CNN (97.13%), DenseNet-LSTM (93.28%), Decision Tree (91.0%), and SVM (88.65%). This confirms the potential of generative AI in capturing complex EEG patterns and advancing automated, high-accuracy seizure prediction.

"Experimental evidence on the impact of GenAI-created personalized video advertisements on engagement. We study the effectiveness of personalized video advertisements created using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). We run a mobile ad targeting field experiment on WhatsApp in partnership with a leading direct-to-consumer e-commerce brand that sells eco-friendly sustainable products. We randomize users into receiving ads from one of three targeting conditions: (1) GenAI-based personalized video ads, (2) personalized image ads, and (3) generic nonpersonalized video ads. The first group is our main treatment, and the latter two serve as baselines. In the personalized treatment conditions, ad content is tailored to individual purchase histories, whereas in the generic treatment condition, a uniform brand message is delivered to all users. Our results show that GenAI-based personalized video ads increase engagement by six to nine percentage points over the baselines. These gains are robust across consumer demographics such as gender and location. We use back-of-the-envelope calculations to highlight substantial cost savings and productivity benefits of GenAI-based personalized ad campaigns. We discuss the implications of our findings for businesses and policymakers while noting the potential variation in effectiveness and generalizability of GenAI applications across marketing contexts.

"This Brief Paper discusses emerging trends from an ongoing study of how undergraduate engineering students at a midwest R1 university engage with Generative AI (GenAI) technologies and how these interactions influence their creative and ethical approaches to engineering work. Using survey data and interviews from fourteen students, initial findings reveal that students often began using GenAI experimentally, with the goals of having fun and testing its capabilities. In doing so, they unintentionally engage in the engineering practice of finding problems in need of solutions. This paper further examines students' ethical concerns related to authorship, accountability, and the ownership of ideas generated by GenAI. Although a human-in-the-loop approach is prevalent, where students critically incorporate GenAI into their learning, writing, and engineering practices, concerns around over-reliance and the ethical implications of GenAI's lack of personhood complicate their relationships with GenAI.

"The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) offers unprecedented opportunities for technological innovation and societal advancement, while also posing significant risks and challenges. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) – exemplified by models such as ChatGPT – relies heavily on deep learning architectures, resulting in increased technical complexity and reduced interpretability. As a result, Generative AI exacerbates a variety of risks common to traditional AI systems, including data security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, copyright infringements, and algorithmic biases. This study critically assesses the adequacy of current regulatory frameworks in addressing these risks. The findings suggest that traditional legal instruments are insufficient for managing the unique challenges posed by Generative AI, increasing the likelihood of regulatory failure. By conducting a comparative analysis of regulatory approaches in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and China, the research reveals a growing global consensus on the necessity of developing responsible and trustworthy AI that aligns with Sustainable development goals.

"ABSTRACT The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has dramatically impacted human decision‐making, productivity, and human agentic role delivery, thereby transforming HRM practices, particularly in recruitment and selection. Traditional recruitment and selection methods involve the dynamic interplay of structure and human agents. This interplay is changing with the emergence of human‐technology‐conjoined agencies that share task delivery and role performance responsibilities, thereby altering and creating new recruitment and selection routines. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 43 HR and talent acquisition leaders in a high‐growth emerging market context to understand the transformational role of discriminative and generative AI technology agencies in changing recruitment and selection practices. This study contributes to existing HRM literature by demonstrating the impact of discriminative and generative AI in recruitment and selection and the simultaneous human‐AI collaboration and algorithmic management of humans emerging as a consequence. Furthermore, we theorize the transformational changes in structures and processes across the entire recruitment and selection process emerging from conjoined agencies.","Dutta, Debolina; Naveen, P.

"As generative AI technologies advance, understanding their capability to emulate human-like experiences in marketing communication becomes crucial. This research examines whether generative AI can create experiential narratives that resonate with humans in terms of embodied cognition, affect, and lexical diversity. An automated text analysis reveals that while reviews generated by ChatGPT 3.5 exhibit lower levels of embodied cognition and lexical diversity compared with reviews by human experts, they display more positive affect (Study 1a). However, human raters struggle to notice these differences, rating half of the selected reviews from AI higher in embodied cognition and usefulness (Study 1b). Instances of hallucination in AI-generated content were detected by human raters. For social media posts, the more sophisticated ChatGPT 4 model demonstrates superior perceived lexical diversity and leads to higher purchase intentions in unbranded content compared with human copywriters (Study 2). This research evaluates the performance of large language models in generating experiential marketing narratives. The comparative studies reveal the models' strengths in presenting positive emotions and influencing purchase intent while identifying limitations in embodied cognition and lexical diversity compared with human-authored content. The findings have implications for marketers and policy makers in understanding generative AI's potential and risks in marketing.","Wen, Yingting; Laporte, Sandra",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/07439156241297973,ux7vyolc75,,,3,Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing,,410,392,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=ux7vyolc75&recordId=ux7vyolc75&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,American Marketing Association,Marketing; Marketing Consulting Services; Language models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Hallucinations (<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Perception (Philosophy),Experiential Narratives in Marketing: A Comparison of Generative AI and Human Content.,44
"The proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) tools has introduced new dynamics in user behaviour, environmental perception, and digital sustainability. This study, based on a primary questionnaire survey of 1,005 GenAI users aged 18 and above from India, investigates the frequency of GenAI usage and its relationship with climate change awareness, environmental concern, and willingness to adopt energy-efficient digital practices. Using regression-based models, the research reveals a pattern of indirect dependence: lower GenAI usage is related with a greater inclination toward environmentally responsible behaviours, such as transitioning from nonsustainable platforms and adopting energy-efficient digital services. In contrast, frequent GenAI users tend to perceive climate change as temporally distant and of lower immediate importance. The study also examines how the frequency and nature of social media usage influence users' attitudes toward sustainable technology choices. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, AI educators, digital strategists, and sustainability advocates aiming to foster environmentally conscious technology adoption in emerging economies like India.","CHITTINENI, Jyothi; MAHESWARI, Palanikumar; SAHILA, Chellamuthu; BALAKRISHNAN, Sathyamurthy",Business Source Ultimate,,10.57017/jorit.v4.2(8).03,mciyv25pgr,,,2,"Journal of Research, Innovation &amp; Technologies (JoRIT)",,172,159,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=mciyv25pgr&recordId=mciyv25pgr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,"Journal of Research, Innovation &amp; Technologies (JoRIT)",Attitudes toward technology; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Attitudes toward the environment; Geographical perception; Mass media influence,Generative Artificial Intelligence and Green Choices: Exploring Environmental Attitudes and Digital Behaviour in India.,4
"Establishing endogenous intelligence capabilities within telecommunication networks in the form of native artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a significant topic of research for promoting the prospects of 6th Generation (6G) networks. In the upcoming 6G era, the network is expected to provide services for building and deploying distributed AI applications in the network infrastructure, and such applications will be used solely by the network or offered to operators or third parties as new services. This paper begins by analysing the current status of standardisation in the network AI domain, and next elaborates on the major shortcomings of the current approaches for natively setting up network AI services. On this basis, we present the concept of Native Network Generative AI (NNGAI), which builds on and further advances the concept of native AI for telecom networks. To formulate the paradigm of NNGAI, we first devise the network architecture, and then finally the underlying logical flow of network services to realize NNGAI by carefully inserting generative AI technologies into both the architecture and the service flow of 6G networks.","Sun, Wanfei; Xu, Hui; Wang, Da; Wang, Hucheng; Guney, Nazli; Saglam, Mehmet Izzet; Gan, Zihui",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SIU66497.2025.11112244,tadwnvm4c5,,,,"2025 33rd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU), Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU), 2025 33rd",,4,1,,True,20250625,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; 6G mobile communication; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Buildings; <mark>Artificial</mark> neural networks; Network architecture; Signal processing; Communications technology; Telecommunications; Native Network <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; 6G Network Architecture; Network Service",Generative 6G Network Architecture and Service: From Native AI to Native Network Generative AI,
"Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the number of services providing generative AI has been steadily increasing. As different services enter the market, the generative AI interfaces users experience become more diverse. However, none of the services has yet established itself as the dominant tool, and which interface component affects user preferences the most has yet to be identified. This study investigates user preferences based on the interface of generative AI services currently on the market. We investigated users' preferred interface components by setting the output data type, generative style, output variation, reference style, and generation history provided by the current generative AI service as properties. We collected data from 500 users through a survey and conducted conjoint analysis. Users preferred the provision of 10 generation histories the most, and the second most preferred the provision of reference style in footnote format. In addition, it was found that there was no preference for the creative generative style, which can be interpreted as users being aware of the problem of hallucination in generative AI. The results of this study will help future generative AI services design interfaces that consider user experience.","Yeon, Jesun; Jung, Youchan; Baek, Yongki; Lee, Daeho; Shin, Jungwoo; Chung, Won Young",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/10447318.2024.2400379,v43zshl6sf,,,12,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,,7637,7626,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=v43zshl6sf&recordId=v43zshl6sf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250615,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,User interfaces; Conjoint analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Logistic regression analysis; Hallucinations (<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>),User Preferences on a Generative AI User Interface Through a Choice Experiment.,41
"Employee-generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) collaboration is becoming increasingly common in the workplace, profoundly impacting the instrumentality of relationships with colleagues. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study investigates how and when employee-GenAI collaboration influences employees' helping behavior and family involvement through the instrumentality of work relationships. The results from a three-wave longitudinal survey study in China indicated that employee-GenAI collaboration is negatively related to the perceived instrumentality of work relationships and helping behavior and positively related to family involvement. The perceived instrumentality of work relationships plays a mediating role in employee-GenAI collaboration, helping behaviors, and family involvement. Furthermore, the perceived credibility of GenAI not only moderates the relationship between employee-GenAI collaboration and the perceived instrumentality of work relationships, but also moderates the mediating role of the perceived instrumentality of work relationships.

"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for effective cyber-defense. Signature-based IDS operate using specific rules which are difficult to generate due to the evolving cybersecurity landscape. To this end, this work proposes a rule generation framework, called RuleXploit, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate rules from exploits. The proposed framework is composed of two components: the RuleXploit Generator, which produces rules using structured prompts and examples, and the RuleXploit Refinery, which validates and refines these rules for accuracy and effectiveness. The RuleXploit framework is demonstrated via the GPT-4o model, configured with tailored prompt engineering techniques and settings. RuleXploit successfully generated 100% syntactically valid rules and achieved an effectiveness rate of 76.67% in detecting malicious traffic. This work presents the first approach to generate IDS rules from the exploit code of a vulnerability, offering a novel way towards the successful mitigation of cyber attacks.","Papoutsis, Angelos; Dimitriadis, Athanasios; Koritsas, Ilias; Kavallieros, Dimitrios; Tsikrika, Theodora; Vrochidis, Stefanos; Kompatsiaris, Ioannis",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSR64739.2025.11130010,etbu7qbujn,,,,"2025 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR), Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR), 2025 IEEE International Conference on",,274,267,,True,20250804,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Accuracy; Translation; Large language models; Retrieval augmented generation; Intrusion detection; Telecommunication traffic; Syntactics; Generators; Vectors; Cyberattack; Intrusion Detection Systems; Cyber-attacks; Rule Generation; Vulnerabilities; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Large Language Models",RuleXploit: A Framework for Generating Suricata Rules from Exploits Using Generative AI,
"As demand grows for event recommendation systems capable of accommodating users with diverse backgrounds and preferences, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention. LLMs offer the ability to flexibly integrate multiple conditions, enabling highly personalized recommendations. However, this flexibility often results in longer prompts, which can degrade response accuracy. Additionally, optimal prompt structures may vary across LLM versions, leading to inconsistent performance.To address these issues, we propose a dynamic prompt optimization method that segments prompts based on LLM evaluations. We conducted experiments using ChatGPT-4o and evaluated the effectiveness of prompt segmentation to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that prompt segmentation improves recommendation accuracy but that its effectiveness saturates beyond a certain threshold. These findings suggest that determining the optimal number of prompt segments maximizes output quality while preventing unnecessary segmentation.","Oomoto, Shiori; Enoki, Miki; Oguchi, Masato",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/COMPSAC65507.2025.00047,kkdkj4p75b,,,,"2025 IEEE 49th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC), Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC), 2025 IEEE 49th Annual, COMPSAC",,300,295,,True,20250708,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Optimization methods; Software; Recommender systems; Large Language Models; Event Recommendation; Prompt Optimization,Optimization of Prompt Segmentation for Improving Event Recommendation Accuracy Using Generative Artificial Intelligence,
"In this article, we introduce multiagent strategic query resolution and diagnostic tool (MASQRAD), a transformative framework for query resolution based on the actor-critic model, which utilizes multiple generative AI agents. MASQRAD is excellent at translating imprecise or ambiguous user inquiries into precise and actionable requests. This framework generates pertinent visualizations and responses to these focused queries, as well as thorough analyses and insightful interpretations for users. MASQRAD addresses the common shortcomings of existing solutions in domains that demand fast and precise data interpretation, such as their incapacity to successfully apply AI for generating actionable insights and their challenges with the inherent ambiguity of user queries. MASQRAD functions as a sophisticated multiagent system but “masquerades” to users as a single AI entity, which lowers errors and enhances data interaction. This approach makes use of three primary AI agents: Actor Generative AI, Critic Generative AI, and Expert Analysis Generative AI. Each is crucial for creating, enhancing, and evaluating data interactions. The Actor AI generates Python scripts to generate data visualizations from large datasets within operational constraints, and the Critic AI rigorously refines these scripts through multiagent debate. Finally, the Expert Analysis AI contextualizes the outcomes to aid in decision-making. With an accuracy rate of 87% when handling tasks related to natural language visualization, MASQRAD establishes new benchmarks for automated data interpretation and showcases a noteworthy advancement that has the potential to revolutionize AI-driven applications.","Ur Rahman, M.W.; Nevarez, R.; Mim, L.T.; Hariri, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TAI.2025.3544173,rhcukpystr,,,8,"IEEE Transactions on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Generative AI needs to collect user data to provide more accurate answers. This may raise users' privacy concern and undermine their disclosure intention. The purpose of this research is to examine generative AI user disclosure intention from the perspective of technological–social affordance. We adopted a mixed method of PLS-SEM and fsQCA to conduct data analysis. The results reveal that perceived affordance of content generation (including information association, content quality, and interactivity), perceived affordance of privacy protection (including anonymity and privacy statement), and perceived affordance of anthropomorphic interaction (including empathy and social presence) affect privacy concern and reciprocity, both of which further affect disclosure intention. The fsQCA identified two paths that trigger user disclosure intention. These results imply that generative AI platforms need to increase users' perceived affordance in order to promote their disclosure intention and ensure the continuous development of platforms.","Zhou, Tao; Wu, Xiaoying",Business Source Ultimate,,10.3390/jtaer20020099,m5imlsukmz,,,2,Journal of Theoretical &amp; Applied Electronic Commerce Research,,,99,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=m5imlsukmz&recordId=m5imlsukmz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,MDPI,Disclosure; Data analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Empathy; Intention,Examining Generative AI User Disclosure Intention: A Perceived Affordance Perspective.,20

"The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is revolutionizing the practice of energy law, offering tools that streamline and slash the costs of regulatory compliance, contract analysis, and litigation preparation. Unlike traditional legal technologies that merely automate existing workflows, GenAI enables practitioners to synthesize vast regulatory data, draft complex documents, and enhance public participation in permitting processes. Regulatory agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), are exploring AI-driven efficiencies in oversight, permitting, and stakeholder engagement. However, the integration of GenAI raises concerns about confidentiality, accuracy, ethical use, and regulatory compliance. Energy practitioners must balance the advantages of AI-driven efficiency with the risks of hallucinations, data security breaches, and lack of explainability in decision-making. Best practices include understanding the capabilities of AI tools, verifying AI-generated legal work, ensuring AI disclosure in regulatory filings, and maintaining professional judgment over AI-assisted outputs. As agencies begin to integrate AI into decision-making, lawyers must advocate for due process protections and transparency in AI-driven decisions. By developing AI competence and implementing ethical safeguards, energy law practitioners can harness the transformative power of GenAI while upholding legal integrity, regulatory fairness, and client trust in an evolving energy landscape. A summary of best practices, based on this article, is provided as Appendix I. The emergence of GenAI marks an inflection point in legal technology that eclipses predecessor innovations. Unlike incremental technology advances that merely automated existing processes, GenAI's capability to produce original human-like content that outperforms lawyers1 or expedites completion of various tasks2 represents a shift that will fundamentally reshape legal practice. These proficiencies coupled with rapid adoption rates unprecedented in the slow-grinding legal profession make GenAI magnitudes more transformative than the introduction of computerized legal research in the 1970s.3 The advancements heralded by GenAI hold particular significance in the energy and utility sectors where complex regulatory frameworks intersect with rapidly evolving market structures and environmental imperatives. GenAI offers unparalleled assistance in navigating the intricacies of energy law, from decoding sector-specific terminology and inside baseball acronyms to synthesizing the tangled web of state and federal regulations, environmental compliance requirements, and dynamic policy landscapes.4 In an era where novel challenges to wholesale markets increasingly strain decision-making processes, GenAI presents opportunities to introduce new efficiencies and expedite resolution pathways. GenAI's potential has not gone unnoticed by the energy sector. The Energy Law Journal previously published two articles that focused specifically on technical applications: one examining utilities' adoption of AI for internal operations and grid management,6 and another exploring AI applications for energy market oversight.7 This article breaks new ground by addressing how GenAI is now expanding beyond these technical use cases into the legal domain of energy practice. Unlike the previous technical focus, we examine how GenAI is transforming law practice, policy-making, and administrative proceedings in the energy sector. Public utility commissioners, administrative law judges, and case intervenors are now leveraging AI to enhance regulatory oversight and improve scrutiny of utility proposals and underlying data.8 Further ahead, GenAI holds the promise of democratizing access to legal expertise for traditionally marginalized participants -- smaller utilities, emerging market entrants, and environmental justice communities -- who have historically been excluded by the prohibitive costs of participation in regional transmission organization stakeholder processes and regulatory proceedings. While acknowledging GenAI's benefits in reducing legal service costs and improving decision-making efficiency, this article also addresses the ethical considerations, potential misuse, and regulatory hurdles that the prior technically-focused articles did not cover. By understanding both the capabilities and limitations of GenAI in legal contexts, energy practitioners can harness this technology responsibly to benefit clients and the broader energy ecosystem.","Elefant, Carolyn",Business Source Ultimate,,,xy4b6xp4hr,,,2,Energy Law Journal,,165,119,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=xy4b6xp4hr&recordId=xy4b6xp4hr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Foundation for the Energy Law Journal,Stakeholder analysis; United States.

"The rapid and widespread integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into educational settings marks a significant paradigm shift, presenting a dual narrative of transformative potential and profound challenges. This paper critically examines the impact of generative AI on education through three interconnected thematic lenses. First, it analyzes the disruptive effects on pedagogical practices and student development, highlighting the tension between the promise of hyper-personalized learning and the risks of intellectual homogenization and student de-skilling. Second, the paper conceptualizes generative AI as a potent instrument of ""soft power."" It argues that AI systems, developed predominantly in the Global North, are embedded with specific cultural and ideological values that can subtly reshape global educational norms, posing a threat to local educational traditions and intellectual sovereignty. Third, the paper employs the ""AI as the new nukes"" metaphor not as a literal comparison but as a critical framework to underscore the urgency for proactive governance and to analyze the systemic, dual-use nature of the technology. By exploring these themes, the paper contends that the primary challenge is not the technology itself, but the preservation of human agency in an increasingly automated world. It concludes by advocating for a form of educational sovereignty, calling for the adoption of robust, human-centric frameworks that prioritize augmentation over automation and critical AI literacy over simple policy enforcement. This requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders--educators, policymakers, students, and developers--to ensure that AI serves as a tool to enhance human potential rather than diminish it, thereby safeguarding the core humanistic values of education.",Aras Bozkurt; Ramesh C.

"Generative AI has become a quotidian discussion topic in many writing departments, and the conversations often focus on the negative aspects or the disruptions it has caused. A growing number of teachers and scholars, though, have embraced the new technology and welcomed it into their classrooms. In the Spring 2024 semester, students in my first-year composition (FYC) classes completed an assignment that asked them to use generative AI to create an essay that they then re-worked through a combination of changing language/phrasing, changing content, and adding/removing content. This chapter argues that students are still doing rich and sophisticated rhetorical work like they would when beginning a piece from scratch. Grounded in Composition theory and scholarship, and featuring students' reflective thoughts on the assignment, this chapter makes the case that students understand and value their own voices in writing. Further, this study challenges the common belief that students want to take the easy way out and use generative AI uncritically.

"In recent years, the number of studies on artificial intelligence or AI has increased tremendously, and their place in daily life is beginning to be felt more and more each day. Current rise of generative AI tools has brought forth dangers regarding its potential misuse, leading to impacts on the environment. College students were surveyed using an infographic and a 5-point Likert scale to assess their awareness regarding these environmental implications. The students exhibited a lack of awareness on most of the implications, only recognizing generative AI's impact on the environment to a certain extent. In particular, the awareness of students on the environmental implications of generative AI such as its carbon footprint resulted in an unclear consensus. Additionally, students only showed an understanding of the electricity that generative AI demands and not also the fresh water and rare metals it consumes. The data suggests that this lack of awareness may stem from insufficient knowledge regarding generative AI. To address these concerns, further promotion in raising awareness was recommended, and an infographic was proposed.",Charles Aaron B. Dungo; Zak Laurence E. Beltran; Bryan C. Declaro; Jan Jacek C.

"The examination of the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on higher education, especially from the viewpoint of students, is gaining significance. Although prior research has underscored GenAI's potential advantages in higher education, there exists a discernible research gap concerning the determinants that affect its adoption. In the present study, we aim to enhance our comprehension of the factors influencing the willingness of higher education students to adopt GenAI tools. To achieve this, we have developed an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model incorporating specific GenAI constructs. Our research methodology entailed the selection of a diverse sample of 374 students through random sampling. We then analyzed their data using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to gain insights into the complex relationships between various variables. The study found that students are more likely to use GenAI tools when they view them as supplemental resource and effort expectancy. It also revealed that perceived costs negatively impact adoption intentions, highlighting that financial factors are a significant barrier. Interestingly, Factors like information accuracy and hedonic motivation did not significantly affect students' adoption intentions. This study offers key insights for eLearning practitioners on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools into educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of resource perception and effort expectancy, demonstrating GenAI's potential to personalize learning experiences. eLearning platforms can utilize GenAI to enhance active learning through engaging methods and streamline course development. Addressing cost barriers is crucial for equitable access and inclusivity. A gradual approach to integration aligned with learning objectives is recommended, along with fostering critical engagement with GenAI tools to enhance digital literacy. Lastly, the study is constrained by its specific context, potential biases in self-reported data, a narrow focus on factors influencing students' intent to use GenAI tools and a cross-sectional design. Future research should encompass a broader range of factors, employ objective measures, and integrate observational data. Longitudinal studies or experimental designs could offer more comprehensive insights into how students' perceptions and intentions develop, thus promoting a more inclusive educational environment for all students.",Hanadi Aldreabi; Nisreen Kareem Salama Dahdoul; Mohammad Alhur; Nidal Alzboun; Najeh Rajeh Alsalhi,ERIC,,,xruysfru3j,,,1,Electronic Journal of e-Learning,,33,15,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=xruysfru3j&recordId=aitwxbqwtv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250101,,Student Behavior; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Natural Language Processing; Technology Uses in Education; College Students; Student Attitudes; Costs; Intention; Student Motivation; Expectation; Accuracy; Technology Integration; Educational Resources; Foreign Countries; Public Colleges; Jordan,Determinants of Student Adoption of Generative AI in Higher Education,23

"Generative AI has recently gained the ability to generate computer code. This development is bound to affect how computer programming is taught in higher education. We used past programming assignments and solutions for textbook exercises in our introductory programming class to analyze how accurately one of the leading models, ChatGPT, generates solutions. We selected the ChatGPT-4 available through the Bing search engine for our testing. We used a one-tailed test to calculate success percentage of the textbook versus ChatGPT solutions to determine if there was a statistically significant difference. Neither the book nor ChatGPT provided perfect solutions. Analysis of the results showed that the generated code does not always meet the programming requirements, but also that instructions for generative AI coding and for traditional programming can be improved. We conclude with recommendations for incorporating generative AI in programming classes. [Note: The publication year (2024) shown in the citation on the PDF is incorrect.

"This paper proposes a framework for integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools into statistical training for Doctor of Education (EdD) students. The rigorous demands of doctoral education, coupled with the challenges of learning complex statistical software and coding language, often lead to anxiety and frustration among students, particularly those in part-time or online programs. This article explores how generative AI can serve as a scaffold for learning, potentially mitigating statistics anxiety and enhancing students' abilities to focus on core statistical concepts rather than software intricacies. The proposed framework, grounded in constructivist learning theory, outlines a process for faculty to facilitate dialogues using generative AI tools that support students in developing research questions, selecting appropriate statistical tests, checking assumptions, and conducting statistical analyses. By leveraging AI as a dialogic partner, students can engage in self-regulated learning and enhance critical thinking skills essential for practitioner-scholars. This approach has the potential to improve statistical training in EdD programs, producing more competent translators of research who can effectively apply and interpret statistical methods in their professional practice.

"In November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, a groundbreaking generative AI chatbot backed by large language models (LLMs). Since then, these models have seen various applications in education, from Socratic tutoring and writing assistance to teacher training and essay scoring. Despite their widespread use among high school and college students in the United States, there is limited research on students' understanding and perception of these technologies. This study aims to fill that gap by developing a novel framework for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) literacy, focusing on what undergraduate students know about generative AI and how they perceive the capabilities of AI chatbots. We designed a GenAI literacy survey to measure students' knowledge and perceptions, collecting data from 568 undergraduate students. The results show that about 60% of students use AI chatbots regularly for academic tasks, but they often overestimate the capabilities of these tools. However, increased knowledge about how generative AI works correlates with more accurate estimation of its capabilities in real-world tasks. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced GenAI and AI literacy to ensure students use these tools effectively and responsibly.

"Millions have adopted tools like ChatGPT in recent years, yet indifference and resistance among employees remain. This qualitative study employs monodramatic projective techniques to explore employees' hidden assumptions and unconscious beliefs in a division attempting to integrate Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI, GAI). Through pretensive work, soliloquy, symbolic representation, modeling with intermediate objects, concretization, and role reversal techniques, the interviewees' internal representations of GAI and trust were materialized in physical artifacts, such as a ball of straw or a potted plant. The study identified three principal themes: GAI's appearance as a Janus-faced presence, unmet performance promises, and avoided proximity. Findings highlight ambiguities in acceptance and show that adoption was driven more by industry hype and normative pressures than genuine organizational needs, leading to disorganized implementation dependent on individual employee characteristics, mistrust, and disenchantment. The study's main contribution lies in refining human-robot interaction (HRI) models and psychodrama methods for GAI, emphasizing the significance of physicality and embodiment in technology-mediated relationships, identifying trust as a complex phenomenon with potential reciprocal causation, and emphasizing the importance of affective attitudes, illustrating how adoption projects can falter despite cognitive openness – all insights crucial for understanding self-driven, bottom-up GAI adaptation in an organizational context.","Hartyándi, Mátyás Jenő",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1556/204.2025.00002,uiwd5uzlfr,,,2,Society &amp; Economy,,255,235,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=uiwd5uzlfr&recordId=uiwd5uzlfr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Akademiai Kiado,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Projective techniques; Trust; Human-robot interaction; Drama therapy,Distrust and disillusionment toward generative artificial intelligence: Psychodramatic exploration of employee trust in organizational technology acceptance.,47

"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education, offering students new opportunities for learning and research. However, concerns about the potential for AI to produce inaccurate or misleading information—commonly referred to as ""hallucinations""—have raised questions about the impact of these tools on student learning and academic integrity. This research paper examines how students' awareness of AI tools, the types of academic tasks they are assigned, faculty support, and institutional policies influence their perceptions and attitudes toward the use of generative AI for academic purposes. The study utilized a descriptive-correlational design, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which provides insights into how users accept and effectively utilize technology. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed as a robust statistical technique to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of generative AI for academic work. The study's constructs were assessed for reliability and validity using Cronbach's Alpha, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio. The findings indicate that the complexity and intensity of academic tasks, students' engagement with generative AI platforms, and the support they receive from educational stakeholders significantly influence their attitudes toward using these platforms for academic assignments. Conversely, students' perceptions of generative AI are heavily shaped by the support systems available to them and their understanding of the potential risks associated with using such technologies for their assignments and projects.

"The emergence of Generative AI technologies, represented by ChatGPT, has triggered extensive discussions among scholars in the education sector. While relevant research continues to grow, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding that systematically measures the effects of Generative AI on student learning outcomes. This study employs meta-analysis to integrate findings from previous experimental and quasiexperimental research to evaluate the impact of Generative AI on student learning outcomes. The analysis of 44 effect sizes from 21 independent studies indicates that Generative AI tools, compared to traditional AI tools or no intervention, moderately enhance student learning outcomes (g = 0.572). These tools significantly improve the cognitive (g = 0.604), behavioral (g = 0.698), and affective (g = 0.478) dimensions of learning outcomes. In addition, the study identifies and examines 6 potential moderating variables: educational level, sample size, subject area, teaching model, intervention duration, and assessment instrument. The results of the moderating effects test reveal that sample size and assessment instrument significantly influence the effectiveness of Generative AI. For sample size, the effect of Generative AI on small samples (g = 1.216) is greater than that on medium (g = 0.476) and large samples (g = 0.547). For assessment instrument, the effect of Generative AI on self-developed tests (g = 0.984) is greater than that on standardized tests (g = 0.557). The meta-analysis result indicated that the use of Generative AI should be supplemented with detailed guidance and flexible strategies.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has opened new possibilities for designing learning analytics (LA) tools, gaining new insights about student learning processes and their environment, and supporting teachers in assessing and monitoring students. This systematic literature review maps the empirical research of 41 papers utilizing GenAI and LA and interprets the results through the lens of the LA/EDM process cycle. Currently, GenAI is mostly implemented to automate discourse coding, scoring, or classification tasks. Few papers used GenAI to generate data or to summarize text. Classroom integrations of GenAI and LA mostly explore facilitating human-GenAI collaboration, rather than implementing automated feedback generation or GenAI-powered learning analytics dashboards. Most papers use Generative Adversarial Network models to generate synthetic data, BERT models for classification or prediction tasks, BERT or GPT models for discourse coding, and GPT models for tool integration.

"In the wave of technological innovation, generative artificial intelligence tools provide college students with personalized learning experience, promote autonomous learning and exploratory learning, and improve learning outcomes through intelligent tutoring and instant feedback. However, existing research shows that generative artificial intelligence tools still face multiple obstacles in practical application, such as differences in students' acceptance of new technologies, privacy protection challenges, and difficulties in integrating with the existing education system. This study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a technology acceptance model, and specifically introduces perceived risk as a moderating variable. Combining key factors such as college students' cognitive characteristics and technological environment, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools.The study found that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and convenience conditions have a significant positive impact on college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools; effort expectations have a positive impact on performance expectations; convenience conditions have a positive impact on effort expectations; effort expectations mediate the relationship between convenience conditions and willingness to use; and perceived risk negatively moderates the impact of convenience conditions on willingness to use. It is expected that through this empirical study, the key factors that affect college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools will be deeply explored, and valuable suggestions and references will be provided for guiding technology optimization and education integration practices, which will help develop generative artificial intelligence tools that better meet the needs of college students and promote innovation and improvement of online education models.","Li, Sigan; Zhang, Hongfeng; Du, Zhijun",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICETT66247.2025.11136950,hbadvpf4mb,,,,"2025 11th International Conference on Education and Training Technologies (ICETT), Education and Training Technologies (ICETT), 2025 11th International Conference on",,70,57,,True,20250523,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Training; Technological innovation; Privacy; Analytical models; Technology acceptance model; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Mathematical models; Usability; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> tools; College students; UTAUT model; PLS-SEM,Factors Influencing College Students’ Willingness to Use Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools——Based on the UTAUT Model,
"With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, especially the rise of large-scale language models and diffusion models, the field of semantic communication is facing new opportunities and challenges. Traditional semantic communication systems have some limitations in conveying semantic information in a dynamic environment, but generative artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to break through this bottleneck with its ability of context understanding and data generation. This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness.

"The convergence of robotics, advanced communication networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of transforming industries through fully automated and intelligent operations. In this work, we introduce a novel co-working frame-work for robots that unifies goal-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) with a Generative AI (GenAI)-agent under a semantic-aware network. SemCom prioritizes the exchange of meaningful information among robots and the network, thereby reducing overhead and latency. Meanwhile, the GenAI-agent leverages generative AI models to interpret high-level task instructions, allocate resources, and adapt to dynamic changes in both network and robotic environments. This agent-driven paradigm ushers in a new level of autonomy and intelligence, enabling complex tasks of networked robots to be conducted with minimal human intervention. We validate our approach through a multi-robot anomaly detection use-case simulation, where robots detect, compress, and transmit relevant information for classification. Simulation results confirm that SemCom significantly reduces data traffic while preserving critical semantic details, and the GenAI-agent ensures task coordination and network adaptation. This synergy provides a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for modern industrial environments.","Li, Peizheng; Aijaz, Adnan",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS65812.2025.11152855,hdzuxcxb2b,,,,"IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250519,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Industries; Service robots; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Robot kinematics; Simulation; Semantic communication; Dynamic scheduling; Real-time systems; Anomaly detection; Next generation networking; <mark>AI</mark>-native network; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> agent; net-worked robotics; semantic communications; variational autoen-coder; workflow",Task-Oriented Connectivity for Networked Robotics with Generative AI and Semantic Communications,
"With the rapid development of XR devices, holographic applications are expanding across various domains. However, it is a consensus that capturing and transmitting real-time holographic content still requires significant bandwidth. Even with the enhanced wireless capabilities of mobile systems, they still fall short of meeting the bandwidth and latency demands required for near-Gigabit per second interactive application scenarios. This paper proposes a network architecture that leverages MEC to address these challenges with the assistant of Generative AI. In this framework, the MEC server can leverage the power of the generative AI model to generate holographic objects with the input of user semantic commands, instead of requiring end-users to capture and transmit large raw holographic data. This approach significantly reduces uplink bandwidth requirements while enabling efficient real-time content generation. To validate this approach, we design an interactive and multisensory operational training scenario relying solely on semantic uplink transmissions from the end-users. The preliminary results based on the testbed implemented highlight the feasibility of deploying diverse holographic applications in wireless environments.","Qian, Peng; Redondo, Carlos Velez; Wang, Ning; Udora, Carl; Men, JingXuan; Tafazolli, Rahim",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS65812.2025.11152969,7osuejh7hv,,,,"IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250519,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Wireless communication; Training; Multi-access edge computing; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Spectral efficiency; Semantics; Bandwidth; Network architecture; Real-time systems; Uplink; Holographic Application; extended reality (XR); mobile edge computing; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>",Enabling Generative AI based Multi-sensory XR Applications with Mobile Edge Computing,

"Recent advances in generative AI have significantly expanded into the realms of art and music. This development has opened up a vast realm of possibilities, pushing the boundaries of human creativity into unexplored frontiers. However, as generative AI advances, it can replicate artistic styles and produce new artwork, posing significant concerns for the perceived rarity and value of artists' creations. In response to these challenges, it is becoming increasingly crucial to establish and enforce protective measures that safeguard artists' copyrighted work from unauthorized exploitation by generative AI models. In this paper, we introduce the first defensive mechanism, HARMONYCLOAK, to prevent the exploitative use of artwork, specifically in the context of instrumental music, by generative AI models. Particularly, HARMONYCLOAK employs imperceptible error-minimizing noise to make the model's generative loss approach zero for these perturbed music data, tricking the model into believing nothing can be learned so as to disrupt their attempts to replicate musical structures and styles. By using a set of intra-track and inter-track objective metrics and a subjective user study, extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art music generative AI models (i.e., MuseGAN, SymphonyNet, and MusicLM) validate the effectiveness and applicability of Harmonycloak 1. 1.

"This study assesses how generative artificial intelligence tools enhance computational thinking and problemsolving skills in the context of programming education. Generative AI (GenAI) has ushered in a new era in programming education, offering immediate, personalised support through tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. Although generative AI tools have shown promise in enhancing immediate problem-solving abilities, there is a lack of research on their long-term effects on students' computational thinking and professional programming skills development. This study conducted a scoped evaluation of previously published papers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standard, and the data was analysed using a thematic approach. The findings from the study indicate that integrating GenAI can potentially enhance computational thinking and problem-solving for programming students. On the flipside, our study highlighted some significant ethical challenges associated with using GenAI in academia, particularly regarding issues of originality in student work. Contrary to expectations on how GenAI tools enhance learners' decomposition, abstraction, and algorithm design skills, most of the findings concentrated on students' completion of tasks. From a practical perspective, it is evident that GenAI has changed the learning landscape therefore, there is a need from a policy perspective to start thinking about the transformational roles of educators.

"Generative AI is rapidly reshaping educational environments, offering transformative possibilities for teaching, learning, and student engagement. As UNESCO DirectorGeneral Audrey Azoulay aptly remarked, “Education will be profoundly transformed by AI.” This transformation impacts not only how knowledge is accessed but also how learning experiences are personalized, how curricula are developed, and how educators are trained. Despite the growing integration of AI tools into education, particularly generative AI, several critical questions remain: How effectively is generative AI being used to support and enhance learning? Are students merely passive recipients of AI-generated content, or are they active participants in more meaningful, personalized learning experiences? What specific generative AI tools are currently being implemented in classrooms, and how do both educators and students perceive their impact and integration? This paper presents the findings of a comprehensive survey conducted at Esprit School of Engineering (ESE) and Esprit School of Business (ESB). The goal is to capture the perspectives of students and teachers on the application and perceived impact of generative AI tools in educational settings. Using a Likert scale, the survey evaluates attitudes toward usability, effectiveness, and the potential of these tools to enhance both teaching and learning outcomes. Additionally, the study explores whether generative AI helps create a more engaging and interactive learning environment. The primary objective of this research is to explore how generative AI is perceived and utilized in classrooms, as well as the barriers and facilitators that affect its adoption. We begin by reviewing the current landscape of generative AI in education, focusing on its most prevalent applications. We then detail the survey methodology and analyze the results, offering insights into both opportunities and challenges posed by these AI tools.

"This paper presents a novel method for enhancing active learning and outcomes in electronic engineering by combining Generative AI for Game-Based Learning (GBL), and transdisciplinary tutoring in Moodle LMS. The approach bridges Analog Electronics (3rd semester) and Digital Design with Microcontrollers (6th semester, embedded systems) engineering courses, fostering collaboration through game-based projects focused on real-world analog-digital integration. Generative AI supports this by generating adaptable game scenarios, problems, and feedback, tailored to each student's learning progress. By incorporating popular game mechanics like Monopoly (for technological evolution), Trivial Pursuit (for component knowledge), and Settlers of Catan (for system design), the approach engages students in key topics like diodetransistor circuits, microcontroller programming, and analogdigital system design. Games are supervised in Moodle using workshop and other activities for peer review, allowing students to submit solutions, review peers' work, and track progress through quizzes, forums, journals, and peer feedback.

"The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked significant interest in education, offering ways to support learning, personalize student experiences, and boost engagement. Generative AI holds the promise of transforming education with personalized learning, instant feedback, and assistance with complex problem-solving. However, its integration into classrooms requires careful management due to ethical concerns, misinformation risks, and potential misuse. While many articles explore the potential of generative AI in education, empirical studies on its real-world classroom use are limited. This paper presents an experience report on deploying a customized GPT-powered chatbot at Qatar University to support learning in two undergraduate courses: Data and Computer Communications Networks (technical) and Computer Ethics. Working across these diverse courses allows a thorough analysis of generative AI's strengths and weaknesses in different academic contexts, offering a comprehensive evaluation of its applicability and effectiveness. We used a mixed-methods approach with over 100 students, collecting quantitative and qualitative data via questionnaires to assess the chatbot's impact. Findings are analyzed with established theoretical frameworks to contextualize the pedagogical impact of generative AI, aligned with UNESCO guidelines for ethical integration. This paper details the chatbot's technical customization to meet course-specific needs, provides evidence-based insights into practical challenges and opportunities, and offers strategic recommendations for effective AI-assisted pedagogy. Directions for further research are also outlined to explore and refine the role of generative AI in classroom settings. By examining two distinct courses, this study demonstrates how generative AI can be adapted across academic disciplines for more nuanced applications in education.","Qadir, Junaid",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016479,eewwfpuucb,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Ethics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Terminology; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Chatbots; Reflection; Real-time systems; Problem-solving; Fake news; Guidelines; ChatGPT; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; pedagogy; education,Generative AI in Undergraduate Classrooms: Lessons from Implementing a Customized GPT Chatbot for Learning Enhancement,
"We are responding to calls for students to be trained in using generative AI (GAI). But training must take account of what students know; their prevailing attitudes; and their ethics with respect to using GAI. And knowing what our students know about GAI gives instructors an opportunity to co-construct meaningful teaching and learning moments. A class of 103 students, enrolled in the course Communication in the Engineering Sciences, in our BSc program in Electrical and Computer Engineering, was probed on their use of generative AI. The study draws on two datasets—student responses to a case study on unethical use of GAI and a questionnaire gathering qualitative data. Questionnaire responses reveal that generally students understand the basics of how GAI works. But this understanding is flawed, for example some students erroneously believe that GAI draws in real time from the Internet. Most respondents have used GAI in their studies, particularly to clarify concepts and summarize. We did not find widespread use of GAI for higher cognitive tasks. But this we suspect is linked to program sequencing: as students advance in their program more sophisticated uses of GAI are likely. This supports the need for longitudinal studies which track use in relation to program advancement. Like peers elsewhere, this class expressed concern about GAI's ability to propagate misinformation and bias; GAI-facilitated plagiarism; data privacy; and overreliance leading to impairment of learning. As it relates to whether GAI qualifies as an author, students demonstrated a fairly nuanced understanding of this complex issue. One student felt that this was a gray area, citing that even outside of GAI generated content, scholars build on each other's work to such an extent that the originality of any work can be questioned. In case study responses, all 103 students agreed that using GAI without permission is dishonest. Respondents noted that students, instructors, and university administration each have a responsibility to ensure that GAI is not misused. And like peers elsewhere, they welcome institutional policy and guidance on using GAI.","Mohammed, Crista; Rocke, Sean",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016545,a7sgfsz23r,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,8,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Ethics; Sequential analysis; Data privacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Plagiarism; Real-time systems; Internet; Engineering education; Fake news; academic honesty; engineering education; ethics; freshmen; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>,"Electrical and Computer Engineering Freshmen and Generative AI: Awareness, Attitudes, and Ethics",
"The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has presented novel opportunities for innovation and practice in the field of education. This study utilizes a questionnaire survey approach to examine the factors influencing the application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in teachers' educational instruction, grounded in Diffusion of Innovation Theory. The research proposes hypotheses that teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction is influenced by seven factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, visibility, information channels, and teachers' personal innovativeness. Through correlation analysis, it is discovered that these influencing factors are significantly correlated with teachers' adoption and application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction. Regression analysis further reveals that compatibility and visibility have significant positive predictive effects on teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence. Based on the data results, this study proposes corresponding strategies to further enhance the diffusion of Generative Artificial Intelligence, aiming to improve the quality and efficiency of teachers' educational instruction, reduce their workload, and promote educational equity and high-quality balanced development.","Zhang, Jing; Liu, Lu; Tian, Yi; Yu, Xiaojie",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11091919,q6fn3z7z6b,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,483,479,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Surveys; Computer science; Technological innovation; Correlation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Ions; Regression analysis; Complexity theory; Diffusion of Innovation Theory; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Digital instruction conducted by teachers; The adopt ion of technology in digital instruction; influencing factors",A Survey on the Application of Generative Artificial Intelligence by Primary and Secondary School Teachers from the Perspective of Innovation Diffusion,

"This study employs a quasi-experimental design to compare the effects of generative AI-supported teacher comments (experimental group) and traditional teacher comments (control group) on pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns in microteaching. Using lag sequence analysis, the study analyzes reflective behavior patterns based on 66 pre-service teachers' reflective texts on microteaching. The results indicate that generative AI-supported teacher comments significantly optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, particularly in terms of breadth and depth. The experimental group's reflective behaviors covered multiple dimensions, including teaching content (CW), teaching process and methods (PW), classroom atmosphere (AW), and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW), demonstrating comprehensiveness. Additionally, their reflective behaviors formed problem chains, such as ""teaching content → teaching process → classroom atmosphere"" (CW→PW→AW), reflecting stronger logic and depth. In contrast, the control group's reflective behaviors primarily focused on basic teaching skills (BW) and teaching process and methods (PW), with insufficient attention to classroom atmosphere (AW) and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW). Their reflections were more superficial and limited. Based on these findings, the study proposes recommendations to optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, aiming to enhance their microteaching reflection abilities and, consequently, their teaching competence development.","Meng, Li; Jiang, Ling; Lin, Yiran; Chen, Na; Hu, Wenshuang",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11092194,65evt3vxzj,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,200,196,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computer science; Sequences; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Atmosphere; Process control; Reflection; Logic; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; teacher comments; pre-service teachers; reflective behavior patterns; microteaching",The Impact of Generative AI-Supported Teacher Comments on Pre-service Teachers' Reflective Behavior Patterns in Microteaching,

"Reproducing the results of a research paper is typically difficult and time consuming. Even when the source code is publicly available, the installation and configuration process can fail due to the slight differences in the versions of the software tools and libraries used by the original authors. Software images and containers are a solution to the dependency issues, since they provide the user with a complete environment with all the necessary components for running the software. But the steps for building such containers must be carefully engineered and described in detail. Generative AI tools may provide a valuable help to the human programmer during the development process. In this paper we present a method for building a software image of an open source code repository, which can be readily reproduced by any user. Generative AI is used for processing the textual information in the repository, and producing the building instructions. The AI agent is able to take into account any errors reported by the user in an iterative dialogue until a successful outcome is obtained.

In this paper, we describe strategies ‒ tools, technologies and policies ‒ that aim to stabilize communication in the face of these challenges. The strategies we discuss fall into two broad categories. Containment strategies aim to reassert context in environments where it is currently threatened ‒ a reaction to the context-free expectations and norms established by the internet.

"Generative AI is an advanced AI subset designed to create new data resembling existing data, widely applied in text generation, image synthesis, and predictive modeling to enhance automation and creativity across industries. Deep learning, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, plays a crucial role in generative AI, as LSTM effectively processes sequential data, making it essential for tasks like natural language processing and time-series forecasting. Data security is critical in generative AI, especially when handling sensitive information. Encryption techniques such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) ensure data security before processing, with AES providing fast encryption and RSA enabling secure key exchanges. Homomorphic encryption allows AI models to process encrypted data without decryption, maintaining confidentiality. Blockchain technology further enhances data security through a decentralized and immutable ledger for verification, employing smart contracts and cryptographic hashing to ensure data integrity. Blockchain-based identity management systems authenticate inputs while preventing unauthorized access, preserving both privacy and security. Implementing encryption and blockchain mechanisms does not compromise generative AI model accuracy, achieving 92.75% accuracy through rigorous testing, validated using benchmarking datasets and performance evaluation metrics.

Drawing on a review of over 70 academic papers, industry reports, and technical documents, this work synthesizes insights from real-world case studies across platforms like Google Play Protect, Microsoft Defender, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apple’s App Store, OpenAI Plugin Stores, Hugging Face Spaces, and GitHub, alongside emerging initiatives like the SAFE Framework and AI-driven anomaly detection.We conclude with practical recommendations for responsible and transparent LLM deployment, including model watermarking, adversarial defense, and cross-industry collaboration—setting a new benchmark for rigorous, holistic cybersecurity research at the intersection of AI and threat defense—and offering a roadmap for secure, scalable LLM systems that serves as a critical reference for researchers, engineers, and security leaders navigating the complex challenges of AI-driven cybersecurity.","Ahi, Kiarash; Valizadeh, Saeed",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SVCC65277.2025.11133642,nqjlewkg4j,,,,"2025 Silicon Valley Cybersecurity Conference (SVCC), Cybersecurity Conference (SVCC), 2025 Silicon Valley",,8,1,,True,20250623,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Surveys; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Web services; Federated learning; Large language models; Malware; Threat assessment; Stability analysis; Computer security; Software development management; Large Language Models (LLMs); Cybersecurity; Dual-Use <mark>AI</mark>; <mark>AI</mark>-Driven Malware; Explainable <mark>AI</mark> (XAI); Zero-Day Detection; Federated Learning; Platform Integrity; ChatGPT; Claude; Gemini; LLaMA; Copilot; Stable Diffusion; OpenAI; Anthropic; Google; Meta; Microsoft; Stability <mark>AI</mark>; Amazon Web Services (AWS); Apple App Store; OpenAI Plugin Stores; Microsoft Defender; Google Play Protect; GitHub; <mark>AI</mark> Governance; Deepfakes; Synthetic Content; <mark>AI</mark> Security; Threat Detection; Anomaly Detection","Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI in Cybersecurity and Privacy: A Survey of Dual-Use Risks, AI-Generated Malware, Explainability, and Defensive Strategies",
"This study explores the role of generative AI (GenAI) in business decision-making among Generation Z (Gen Z), transitioning from AI-driven consumer behaviours to strategic professional applications. While Gen Z is highly proficient in using AI for personalized recommendations in consumer settings, their ability to critically engage with AI for complex decision-making in workplace environments remains a challenge. Through an experimental study, this research evaluates how Gen Z interacts with AI tools when selecting enterprise software solutions. Findings indicate that Full-Process Assistance approaches yield the most effective results, whereas Identification and Comparison approaches exhibit gaps in justification and iterative refinement. Additionally, AI's evaluation mechanisms sometimes misclassify decision success, highlighting the need for structured AI literacy programs and enhanced AI assessment frameworks. The study underscores the necessity of integrating AI literacy into educational curricula and refining AI tools to support Gen Z professionals in making informed, strategic business decisions. Future research should focus on AI-human hybrid decision models to ensure AI serves as a collaborative tool rather than an unquestioned authority in professional environments.","Belludi, Suraj; Kopackova, Hana",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ZINC65316.2025.11103526,bzf5e7kg2z,,,,"2025 IEEE Zooming Innovation in Consumer Technologies Conference (ZINC), Zooming Innovation in Consumer Technologies Conference (ZINC), 2025 IEEE",,124,119,,True,20250528,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Technological innovation; Consumer behavior; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Decision making; Refining; Employment; Software; Iterative methods; Zinc; Business; <mark>AI</mark>-assisted decision-making; Generation Z",Beyond AI-Powered Shopping: Can Gen Z Apply Generative AI for Business Decision?,
"With the prevalence of generational artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life, there has been a recent increase in research on individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards generational AI. However, with the breadth of use cases and applications made available with the advancements in large language models (LLMs), there are increasing signs that attitudes towards LLM-based generative AI may be context or use-case dependent. We examine the contextualised trust of individuals in AI, the support for using AI, and AI adoption intentions in a survey experiment ($\mathrm{N}=306$) across three contexts (reasons): technical, mental health, and creative assistance. Participants read ostensible news articles about AI use in one of these three contexts, and completed a survey on their resultant and previous attitudes. The results show that trust and adoption were significantly higher for technical assistance, and lower for creative assistance and mental health assistance. However, support for using AI for mental health assistance was significantly higher than creative assistance, and comparable to technical assistance. Contextualised trust and support also significantly predicted AI adoption intentions, above and beyond trust scores towards AI in general. Our study suggests that contextualised attitudes towards specific AI products appear to be sufficiently differentiated from (general) AI attitudes, and instances where AI is used for technical reasons, as opposed to creative or mental health reasons, garners more favourable attitudes.","Liew, Kongmeng; Wu, Xiaoli; Zhang, Zhouqing",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CAI64502.2025.00051,ciz64m5woz,,,,"2025 IEEE Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (CAI), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (CAI), 2025 IEEE Conference on, CAI",,6,1,,True,20250505,IEEE,Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Signal Processing and Analysis; Surveys; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Buildings; Mental health; Assistive technologies; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Trust; Support; Adoption Intentions; Experiment; Social Psychology,"Trust, Support, and Adoption Intentions Towards Generative AI are Context Dependent",

"This paper explores the integration of generative AI (GenAI) in the feedback process in higher education through a learning analytics (LA) tool, examined from a feedback literacy perspective. Feedback literacy refers to students' ability to understand, evaluate, and apply feedback effectively to improve their learning, which is crucial for fostering self-regulated learning and academic growth. GenAI has the potential to open new avenues of research and design in augmenting feedback practices by providing innovative, personalized, and scalable feedback solutions. The study investigates how GenAI functionalities, specifically ChatGPT explanation features and GenAI-powered dashboard visualizations, can support students in engaging with feedback. Using feedback literacy theory, a thematic analysis was conducted and triangulated with usage trace data to assess students' perceptions of these functionalities. The study involved three key activities: introductory lab sessions, in-semester use of the GenAI-powered LA feedback tool, and post hoc interviews, with data collected from 18 students from various disciplines (information technology, education, business and economics, and engineering) throughout all phases. Initial findings from the lab sessions showed positive perceptions of the GenAI functionalities. However, trace data from in-semester use indicated modest engagement with GenAI. Post hoc interviews revealed that reduced engagement was due to a mismatch between the GenAI outputs and student expectations. While some students appreciated the GenAI functionalities, others found them redundant when they perceived the feedback as clear and easy to understand. This study highlights the potential of GenAI in the feedback process and underscores the challenges of aligning AI tools with diverse student needs. Future developments should focus on creating adaptive and discipline-specific GenAI solutions.",Flora Ji-Yoon Jin; Bhagya Maheshi; Wenhua Lai; Yuheng Li; Danijela Gasevic; Guanliang Chen; Nicola Charwat; Philip Wing Keung Chan; Roberto Martinez-Maldonado; Dragan Gaševic; Yi-Shan Tsai,ERIC,,,kdgv776kin,,,1,Journal of Learning Analytics,,168,152,,True,20250101,,College Students; Student Attitudes; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Learning Analytics; Feedback (Response); Multiple Literacies; Attitude Change; Student Evaluation; Learner Engagement,Students' Perceptions of Generative AI-Powered Learning Analytics in the Feedback Process: A Feedback Literacy Perspective,12
"The aim of this project was to identify ways in which students are using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technologies for the planning and researching stage of essay style assignments. The study recruited 30 students from various subject areas and levels of study and with different self-reported levels of confidence in using GAI tools. Each student was given three essay questions to choose from and 50 minutes to research their topic, make notes from sources, and put together an essay plan, using GAI tools if they deemed them useful. Their screens were recorded to facilitate a natural planning process and they were encouraged to narrate to provide insight into their reasoning. Of the 30 participants, 21 (70%) used GAI technologies within their process. ChatGPT 3.5 (Open AI) was the most frequently chosen, with 18 students (60%) using this. The most popular use of GAI was asking for definitions, explanations, or examples; or creating an essay plan or structure. The study also provided insight into students' searching process, revealing that Google was the most popular starting point (chosen by 30% of students). Journal articles were the most popular source type (used by 80% of participants), and skim reading a section of a source was the most common method used to decide if it was relevant, with 63.3% of students doing this.

"The use of generative AI (Chat GPT) for the process of posing mathematical problems was introduced to 15 pre-service teachers (henceforth referred to as ""teachers"") in a re-training program aimed at teaching advanced secondary school mathematics. After solving mathematical problems, they were given an assignment to pose and refine additional problems in accordance with the curriculum requirements by giving ""prompts"" to the AI environment and refining them as needed. In this paper, we focus on the qualitative analysis of three key stages experienced by the teachers: writing the initial prompt to request assistance from ChatGPT to improve the problem; the response provided by ChatGPT; and the teachers' reflections on how they utilized ChatGPT's recommendations to update and refine their problem. This analysis reveals that the chat's responses and the teachers' reactions to them made several key contributions to improving mathematical problems, particularly by enhancing the clarity of the problem and increasing its challenge and complexity. Additionally, it improved mathematical precision and showed how it could be linked to real-world applications, thereby increasing student engagement. The chat also encouraged inquiry-based thinking and provided guidance for helping struggling students. Overall, these contributions significantly enhanced the quality of the mathematical problems and improved their TPACK (theoretical, pedagogical, and content knowledge).",Yaniv Biton; Ruti Segal,ERIC,,,2qdk2kvq6b,,,1,"International Journal of Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology",,223,202,,True,20250101,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Natural Language Processing; Technology Uses in Education; Preservice Teachers; Mathematics Teachers; Pedagogical Content Knowledge; Technological Literacy; Problem Solving; Skill Development; Mathematics Instruction; High School Teachers; Advanced Courses; Editing; Revision (Written Composition); Mathematical Concepts,Learning to Craft and Critically Evaluate Prompts: The Role of Generative AI (ChatGPT) in Enhancing Pre-Service Mathematics Teachers' TPACK and Problem-Posing Skills,13
"Student attrition remains a significant challenge for higher education institutions, particularly during the freshman to sophomore year transition. This study introduces a comprehensive decision-support framework that integrates state-of-the-art predictive machine learning (ML) techniques, local ML explanation techniques, and Generative AI to enhance individualized intervention programs aimed at reducing freshman student attrition. Utilizing a dataset encompassing 13 years of enrollment data from a sizable US academic institution, we developed predictive models using deep neural networks to identify students at risk of leaving school with an overall accuracy of 86%. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was then used to enhance the transparency of the model by providing granular insights into the contribution of various factors to individual students' dropout risks. Notably, we employed Generative AI to translate SHAP scores into comprehensible and actionable intervention recommendations presented via an interactive decision-support dashboard. This dashboard aids school administrators in designing personalized support strategies for at-risk students at the individual level. By leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of Generative AI, our framework offers a novel approach to understanding and simulating human behavior in educational settings, emphasizing the importance of precise individual-level insights.

"The application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in certain operations of the public sector has been viewed as a revolutionary use aiming at improving efficiency, resource management, and facilitating the implementation of modern governance through informed decisions backed by evidence. This research article looks at the ability of generative AI to transform the institution of public administration by dealing with the problems of waisted resources, improving accountability and increasing citizen participation. The areas of focus include efficiency of the administration, optimization of resources, Governance models based on data, barriers to adoption of AI, public engagement, Ethical issues. The research employs Therese as a methodology consisting of the integration of quantitative and qualitative forms to study the impact of generative AI on the structures of governance frameworks. The results offer an interesting insight as there is substantial evidence which suggests that users who believe there are efficiency improvements resulting from AI tools, are likely to use such tools (r=0.78, p&lt;0.01), which shows that AI tools can provide more efficiency in the processes and minimise delays that would otherwise be associated with bureaucracies. AI's capacity to anticipate how much resources would be needed and for how long resources can be optimally utilized is supported by example where there was a 20% reduction in urban development project budget wastage. In addition, AI provide raw data analytical inputs through their models which increases efficiency up to 35%, where this data was utilized to improve urban management. On the other hand, the research also reveals some other challenges such as lack of digital infrastructures, inadequately skilled workforce, and unenthusiastic attitude towards innovations that are crucial for scaling the usage of AI. These challenges should be addressed mainly through strategic approaches such as embarking on capacity building and partnerships with private organizations to provide joint Services.","NICA, Elvira; POPESCU, Gheorghe; GRUPAC, Marian; HURJUI, Marcela Cristina; PÂRVU, Ioana Alexandra",Business Source Ultimate,,,7kghnnhpen,,,2,Management Research &amp; Practice,,56,35,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7kghnnhpen&recordId=7kghnnhpen&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Academia de Studii Economice,Public sector; Economic efficiency; Organizational governance; Resource allocation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Political participation; Ethical problems,"REVOLUTIONIZING PUBLIC SECTOR OPERATIONS WITH GENERATIVE AI: ENHANCING EFFICIENCY, OPTIMIZING RESOURCES, AND EMPOWERING DATA-DRIVEN DECISION-MAKING FOR MODERN GOVERNANCE.",17
"Generative AI (GenAI) tools, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, are rapidly reshaping higher education by transforming how students, educators, and researchers engage with learning, teaching, and academic work. Despite their growing presence, the adoption of GenAI remains inconsistent, largely due to the absence of universal guidelines and trust-related concerns. This study examines how trust, defined across three key dimensions (accuracy and relevance, privacy protection, and nonmaliciousness), influences the adoption and use of GenAI tools in academic environments. Using survey data from 823 participants across different academic roles, this study employs multiple regression analysis to explore the relationship between trust, user characteristics, and behavioral intention. The results reveal that trust is primarily experience-driven. Frequency of use, duration of use, and self-assessed proficiency significantly predict trust, whereas demographic factors, such as gender and academic role, have no significant influence. Furthermore, trust emerges as a strong predictor of behavioral intention to adopt GenAI tools. These findings reinforce trust calibration theory and extend the UTAUT2 framework to the context of GenAI in education. This study highlights that fostering appropriate trust through transparent policies, privacy safeguards, and practical training is critical for enabling responsible, ethical, and effective integration of GenAI into higher education.","Đerić, Elena; Frank, Domagoj; Milković, Marin",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/info16070622,5xxae26pcn,,,7,Information,,,622,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=5xxae26pcn&recordId=5xxae26pcn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Gemini (Chatbot); Trust; Multiple regression analysis; Innovation adoption,"Trust in Generative AI Tools: A Comparative Study of Higher Education Students, Teachers, and Researchers.",16

"This research examines generative AI (GenAI) use in a university course that encouraged ChatGPT for specific assignments. Using the Pedagogical Centered AI (PCAI) framework, we explore how students perceive, use, and position ChatGPT, and how usage patterns influenced performance. Students utilized ChatGPT during the latter half of the Spring 2024 semester. Comparisons were made with the first half of the course and prior iterations (2022 and 2023) without GenAI. All students in the 2024 cohort — 40 students — were invited to participate in the study. Data includes 18 student interviews from the 2024 cohort and student work from all iterations. Interviews underwent qualitative deductive thematic analysis using PCAI’s predefined codes PCAI frames AI in education through six learning theories: behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, social constructivism, experiential learning, and communities of practice. Class materials and academic records were analyzed to assess performance quantitatively using inferential statistics. Findings reveal students predominantly view AI from a behaviorist perspective: as a tool for completing tasks. Some aligned usage with cognitive learning theory by using AI to reduce cognitive load, while others adopted social constructivist or constructivist perspectives, using AI to build understanding through feedback and exam preparation functions. Overuse of ChatGPT correlated with lower grades, though only one student acknowledged its negative impact on learning. We discuss implications for higher education and highlight how ChatGPT supports diverse teaching and learning approaches tailored to students’ needs. In particular, strategies aligned with constructivism, social constructivism, and communities of practice approaches seem to enhance student learning. However, behaviorist approaches to AI use could hinder learning outcomes.

"Generative AI has flourished over the past decade, with generative models advancing in both the industrial and academic sectors. Given various applications, some scenarios have seen the misuse of generative AI, particularly in the integration with the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT devices often handle personal and sensitive data, raising serious concerns about privacy leakage and security breaches when generating data. As a promising countermeasure, machine unlearning has emerged to solve the problems posed by these generative models by effectively removing specific concepts or sensitive information from trained models. In this survey, anchored in generative models, machine unlearning approaches are reviewed, categorized, and discussed comprehensively and systematically. Existing unlearning approaches are classified into gradient-based techniques, task vectors, knowledge distillation, data sharding, and reliable unlearning methods. Apart from previous works, this survey extends the review of attack methods that aim to exploit the vulnerability in generative models and assess the robustness of these unlearning methods. In addition, popular metrics and datasets in machine unlearning research are summarized and evaluated based on effectiveness, efficiency, and security.

"With the development of the sixth generation (6G) networks, ubiquitous intelligence, computing, and networking integration, low energy consumption, and low delay have become the key characteristics. These characteristics pose significant challenges for traffic scheduling, particularly in the context of intelligent computing services. In recent years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated remarkable performance not only in natural language processing and image generation but also in network optimization. This article presents a generative AI-endogenous three-layer network architecture, named GenNet, to support more efficient scheduling of intelligent computing services in 6G networks by the dynamic adaptation of heterogeneous computing resources and diversified service requirements. Moreover, we propose a dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN)-based transmission scheduling algorithm that leverages diffusion models to achieve cross-domain end-to-end deterministic transmission. The proposed algorithm facilitates efficient interaction between edge devices and intelligent computing centers while reducing system cost and delay, and utilizes the denoising capability of the diffusion model to adaptively configure networks and optimize resource allocation.

Während zahlreiche Forschungsbeiträge technische, soziale und ethische Aspekte generativer KI untersuchen, adressiert dieser Beitrag insbesondere die strategischen, technologischen und organisationalen Herausforderungen bei der Implementierung generativer KI. Anhand einer Fallstudie bei der DZ BANK AG wird untersucht, wie ein hybrider Plattformansatz eine strategisch fundierte Einführung generativer KI ermöglicht. Technologisch stellt die zentrale IT standardisierte und wiederverwendbare Komponenten bereit, während die Fachbereiche eigenständig KI-basierte Lösungen entwickeln und anpassen. Organisational erfordert dies eine enge Abstimmung zwischen zentraler Steuerung und dezentraler Nutzung, um sowohl Skalierbarkeit als auch Flexibilität zu gewährleisten. Ein iterativer Rollout in „Wellen“ kombiniert technologische Absicherung mit einer stufenweisen Integration in bestehende Geschäftsprozesse. Die Plattform bietet nicht nur eine kontrollierte und sichere Infrastruktur, sondern adressiert auch Herausforderungen wie regulatorische Anforderungen, Datenqualität und die notwendige Qualifikation der MitarbeiterInnen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der Plattformansatz technologische Komplexität reduziert und gleichzeitig organisationale Agilität fördert. Finanzunternehmen profitieren von kürzeren Entwicklungszyklen, einer effizienteren Prozessgestaltung und einer breiteren Einbindung der MitarbeiterInnen. Abschließend werden praxisorientierte Handlungsempfehlungen für eine erfolgreiche Implementierung generativer KI in der Finanzbranche abgeleitet.","Breiter, Katharina; Lohmann, Tobias; Stahl, Bastian; Zilmans, Carolin; Reischl-Lenz, Birgit; Gimpel, Henner",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1365/s40702-025-01166-8,7llay2kh25,,,5,HMD Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik,,1230,1212,,True,20251001,Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden,<mark>Generative</mark> Künstliche Intelligenz; Plattform; Strategie; Finanzbranche; Fallstudie; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Platform; Strategy; Financial Sector; Case Study,"Generative KI in der Finanzbranche: Strategische, technologische und organisationale Implementierung am Beispiel der DZ BANK AG",62
"This study focuses on the application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of cultural creation and communication, and proposes an innovative multimodal fusion generative adversarial network algorithm (MM-GAN). The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.","Wang, Chen",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICIPCA65645.2025.11138882,7hg76f725b,,,,"2025 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Image Processing and Computer Applications (ICIPCA), Image Processing and Computer Applications (ICIPCA), 2025 IEEE 3rd International Conference on",,1801,1796,,True,20250628,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Deep learning; Vocabulary; Visualization; TV; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Heuristic algorithms; Semantics; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Cultural differences; Global communication; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; cultural creation; deep learning; multimodal fusion <mark>generative</mark> adversarial network; experimental simulation",Research on Deep Learning of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Cultural Creation and Communication,
"Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of vision loss globally, and its early detection contributes to preventing complications. In this context, an architectural framework is proposed for retinal image generation in diabetic retinopathy. The generated images are subjected to a systematic clinical validation process conducted by ophthalmologists to assess their alignment with the clinical manifestations of diabetic retinopathy and enhance their applicability in pathology analysis. The dataset used for training, testing, and validating the generative model must possess an adequate volume and a balanced class distribution. High visual quality and accurate representation of the morphological features specific to each stage of diabetic retinopathy are fundamental elements for achieving the targeted outcomes.

"The remarkable capacity of generative large language models such as GPTs, to generate high-quality content in a variety of fields that nearly mimics human writing has garnered attention in recent years, posing significant problems in differentiation. Consequently, it is now more important than ever to detect machine-generated text. PAN 2024 organizes a competition for differentiating the text written by human or machine. They provided the dataset of human writings and machine generated texts. In this work, we developed a hybrid model for predicting whether the text was generated by the human or a machine. The proposed model integrates the stylistic features and embeddings from two sophisticated transformer models, such as RoBERTa and T5 models. The PAN 2024 Generative AI Authorship Verification dataset is used in this experiment. The dataset contains files of concepts that are written by humans and different large language models. In the proposed model, the files are represented as vectors by combining the stylistic features based vector representation and word embedding techniques based vector representation. These vectors are forwarded to LightGBM algorithm for training. The performance of proposed model represented in terms of numerous evaluation metrics such as ROC-AUC, C@1, Brier, F0.5u, F1, and mean. The proposed hybrid model attained scores of 0.996 for ROC-AUC, 0.970 for Brier, 0.989 for C@1, 0.972 for F1, 0.971 for F0.5u, and 0.979 for mean on the training dataset.

"The process of visual inspection has been significantly improved with addition of AI with human in the loop. In this paper, we introduce new features to enhance our end–to‒end visual inspection framework for HBMs. We detect individual HBMs consisting of multiple components along with providing a full report for the scanned chip providing 3D metrology information, details on defects and possible root cause analysis for the defects. Our modular approach can integrate any object detection and segmentation deep learning model based on the inspection requirements. We introduce a multi-view approach to increase the robustness of the detection and identification framework for defective bumps. Our approach can directly process high-resolution 3D scans and generate automatically an inspection report from our generative AI model. On our HBM dataset, the defective bump identification increased by 46%. We also conduct a study on learning with less labels. With varied percentages of labeled data, we achieved segmentation accuracy of 87% on memory bumps respectively with only utilizing 25% labelled bumps for training our AI models. The Inspection reports are customized using our 3D Metrology toolbox and Large Language Models (LLMs) providing possible causes and suggestions. We then propose a fully automated system, that with one click is able to provide a comprehensive report of the entire dense 3D scan consisting of more than 400 bumps in under 5 minutes.

"Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is becoming a key technology in 6 G networks, where sensing based on channel state information (CSI) plays an essential role. Present research primarily focuses on enhancing sensing performance, yet often overlooks security issue, especially the threat of unauthorized sensing that tends to receive little attention. In response to the above threat, this paper proposes to use generative AI to enhance the security of CSI-based sensing systems. Specifically, we design the guarding signal according to the characteristics of CSI fluctuations caused by user activities and build the corresponding database based on the measurements collected by software-defined radio. Utilizing the constructed dataset, we train the conditional generative diffusion model, which can produce guarding signals that are similar yet distinct from the original training samples. Then, these guarding signals are modulated onto pilot signals, effectively masking the user-induced fluctuations, thereby preventing unauthorized devices from performing illegitimate sensing. Taking the user activity recognition as the example, experimental evaluations illustrate that the proposed method reduces the recognition accuracy of unauthorized devices by about 75 %, significantly enhancing user privacy protection against unauthorized sensing.","Wang, Jiacheng; Feng, Chenyuan; Sun, Geng; Du, Hongyang; Niyato, Dusit; Quek, Tony Q.

"Mood journals support emotional self-reflection and awareness, but sustaining user motivation remains a challenge. CRAFTJAI, a gamification-driven AI framework, enhances the journaling experience by integrating generative AI, transforming diary entries into AI-generated visual mood characters to make the process more interactive and expressive. By incorporating gamification principles from Self-Determination Theory and the Octalysis model, CRAFTJAI emphasizes motivation and personalization to encourage long-term engagement. It employs LLMs for mood analysis and character generation, while LoRA fine-tuning enhances text-to-image synthesis, improving visual coherence and emotional expressiveness. The evaluation assessed five criteria: unpredictability and curiosity, diary alignment, style consistency, meaning and calling, and ownership and possession, demonstrating an 8% overall improvement over the baseline. The most significant gains were observed in diary alignment and style consistency, validating the effectiveness of fine-tuning in enhancing emotional representation and visual coherence. A real-world study further evaluated engagement across five key metrics: anticipation, motivation to collect, sense of accomplishment, community sharing, and long-term engagement, all mapped to gamification principles. Results strongly supported the fine-tuned method, with all metrics surpassing 80%, confirming its effectiveness in sustaining user motivation.

"The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology into satellite-based Internet services offers a new method for optimizing predictive beamforming that will boost both ease of use and cost efficiency.Old-fashioned beamforming technique is based on determinism and historical information methods which often cannot adapt to environmental change, network congestion or user mobility. This article explores how generative AI models (like variational autoencoders [VAEs], generative adversarial networks [GANs], or transformer-based architectures) can help to forecast optimal level settings for a beam in real-time.Using huge amounts of satellite telemetry, weather patterns and user traffic data, generative AI can synthesize realistic future network states, cut down on latency and improve signal coverage.AI-driven beamforming entails architectural considerations, training methodologies, and deployment issues.

"Generative AI has completely changed content creation, as it empowered the generation of diverse media that could be in text, images, or even audio. As these technologies roll out in different sectors - from entertainment to healthcare and education-they bring with them deep-seated ethical concerns, particularly those around issues of bias. The paper addresses the intrinsic biases which come from the training datasets, reflecting existing prejudices in society. Such biases might have devastating implications leading to stereotype enforcement and persistent inequality. We explore the various types of bias introduced by generative AI and the ethical implications of such bias when applied to practical usage scenarios. Additionally, we review the contemporary frameworks and methods that diminish bias, for instance FairGAN and FairGAN+ which introduce fairness constraints during the generative process.

"Design thinking (DT), widely recognized as a structured method for fostering creativity and innovation, has gained significant traction in research and practice across various disciplines. However, with the rise of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), DT practices are gradually evolving, reshaping the innovation process. This study investigates the effectiveness of integrating generative AI into a product design thinking activity, employing a single-group pretest-posttest design (i.e., without a control group). The time interval between pretest and posttest measurements was four hours, coinciding with the duration of the DT activity. Conducted in a chemical engineering course at a private university in central Mexico, the research tasked nine students of average academic performance with designing a new beverage. Over a four-hour session, students used AI tools-ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini-at various stages of the design process, including empathy mapping, need statements, idea classification, hills writing, and storyboarding. Several multidimensional constructs were measured using self-report questionnaires to assess the key attributes that DT stimulates: perceptions of creative self-efficacy, design thinking mindset, and empathy. Additionally, the study explored students' views on the usefulness of generative AI and their intention to use such tools. It was hypothesized that post-test scores for each construct would increase. The analysis involved two phases: first, psychometric indicators (alpha reliability) were obtained; second, a statistical approach for assessing individual change was applied, precisely the standardized individual difference (SID).

"In an era where technology plays a significant role in the lives of people of all ages, adapting to rapidly advancing technology is essential. Lifelong learning, which integrates formal, non-formal, and informal education, helps learners develop skills and abilities independently. Programming skills serve as an example of lifelong learning, requiring the development of technical skills such as programming, planning, and testing, as well as communication, teamwork, and systematic thinking. This research focuses on utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) to enhance programming skills through self-directed learning combined with interactive learning. The study was conducted with 21 students enrolled in the Higher Vocational Certificate (Diploma) program in Mechatronics and Robotics. The study applied the MAR model, which consists of three stages: The motivation stage, is designed to encourage learners to engage in activities that link prior knowledge or experiences with new knowledge, thereby fostering self-directed learning motivation, such as designing personalized learning activities based on individual interests; the Activity stage, which provides opportunities for learners to use Generative AI technology for self-directed learning according to their goals and plans, enabling them to understand concepts, apply knowledge in various situations, and track their learning progress; and the Reflection and Progress stage, focusing on reviewing, analyzing, and reflecting on learning outcomes, as well as exchanging ideas and skills with peers and receiving constructive feedback. These stages were designed based on theoretical foundations and a literature review. Furthermore, the research emphasized ethical considerations in AI use, such as data privacy and societal impacts, to promote high-quality, beneficial lifelong learning. The findings showed that before the learning process, the learner had no background in programming and had never used AI technology. However, after participating in the learning activities, students became more open to learning and responded positively to the self-designed activities, which aligned with their interests and skills related to their field of study. These findings suggest that this learning process, when implemented effectively, can be applied to lifelong learning for individuals of all genders and ages.","Puttajanyawong, Nuttapon; Suamuang, Wuttiporn; Chomsuwan, Komkrit",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016488,wabmf4izkn,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,9,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Systematics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Reflection; Teamwork; Planning; Programming profession; Robots; Testing; Systematic literature review; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Self-Directed Learning; Interactive Learning,Utilizing Generative AI to Develop Programming Skill Through Self-Directed and Interactive Learning,
"Generative AI (GAI) can be leveraged to good effect in engineering, technology, and computing (ETC) classrooms but with pre-conditions; among these include teacher preparedness. One dimension of teacher preparedness is knowing how GAI is used in classrooms like their own. This paper responds to that need. The paper surveys the literature to answer three questions: in formal instructional interventions, what were the tasks for which GAI was used; what methods did scholars use to evaluate the GAI instructional set; and what were some of the identified challenges and opportunities regarding the use of GAI in ETC classrooms? Taking account of quality and recency of scholarship, and the need to focus on ETC practices, a rapid review of IEEE FIE conference proceedings for 2023 and 2024 was undertaken. Of the 1,181 papers published in both conference proceedings, and after a two-stage screening process, 20 papers were selected for synthesis. Of the 20 papers examined in this review, we found seven patterns of research design. The most common was the learning and teaching intervention followed by gathering student feedback. While we expect that a bigger corpus will yield additional research designs, these seven provide a start for defining a typology of research design investigating student use of GAI. The review revealed eight distinct categories of use ranging from software development, the most common, with over 26 distinct tasks, to data classification and data analysis, each with two distinct tasks. GAI was found to be used for many low-cognitive tasks like generating bibliographies to cognitivelydemanding uses like design and modeling. The studies reported recurring concerns about using GAI, like perpetuating bias, and hallucinations. One striking empirical finding is that previous ways of accomplishing ETC tasks, like using MATLAB and hand analysis, may be quicker and easier than using GAI. The scholarship advocates for broad and deep GAI literacy programs, addressing GAI abilities, limitations, ethics of use, and prompt design. Moreover, instructors are encouraged to be GAI literate themselves. This know-how is central to designing meaningful GAI-based tasks which seek to prepare students for an increasingly AI-infused world and workplace.","Mohammed, Crista; Sarjusingh, Wayne; Rocke, Sean",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016366,skw2t5cbbf,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,7,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Surveys; Hands; Ethics; Reviews; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Scholarships; Employment; Engineering education; MATLAB; Software development management; engineering education; engineering; technology and computing education; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>,"Uses of Generative AI in Engineering, Technology, and Computing Classrooms: Findings From the IEEE FIE Conference Proceedings",
"Generative AI has emerged as a transformative tool in the realm of higher education, offering a wealth of opportunities for personalized learning, automated feedback, and enhanced collaboration. However, its successful adoption within university environments is significantly dependent on the trust it earns from its users, particularly students. This study investigates the levels of trust and the adoption of Generative AI among students enrolled in both German and international study programs at Hochschule Bielefeld (HSBI) and its transnational partner, Hainan Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences (BiUH). Utilizing a comprehensive questionnaire, the research explores students' perceptions of the trustworthiness of Generative AI, their usage patterns, and their concerns regarding the ethical and academic implications of its use. Preliminary findings suggest that while students widely recognize the potential of Generative AI to improve learning outcomes and efficiency, the degree of trust in its reliability and fairness varies significantly. Key factors influencing this trust include the transparency of AI systems, the perceived accuracy of outputs, and concerns about bias and misuse. Students in international and cross-cultural programs face additional challenges, such as language barriers and cultural differences, which affect how AI is perceived and utilized. Ethical concerns, particularly regarding plagiarism and academic integrity, are prevalent across all groups, underscoring the need for clear institutional guidelines and policies. The findings highlight the importance of fostering AI literacy and providing support structures to build trust and encourage responsible use. Recommendations include the implementation of transparent AI tools, tailored training programs, and the development of ethical guidelines to ensure that Generative AI enhances education while upholding academic standards.

"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is emerging as a transformative force that empowers transnational education (TNE) in engineering. Recent trends indicate a significant shift in the application of generative AI in engineering policies, academic research, business practices, and educational settings throughout TNE. Governments and organizations are transitioning from restrictive stances to developing guiding frameworks for its application, enabling cross-border collaboration in TNE. Numerous universities have permitted and even promoted the utilization of GAI. Furthermore, academic research around the world is looking into the pros and cons of GAI in engineering education, focusing on how it can help teachers and keep students interested. Industrial applications are diversifying, extending across disciplines, and TNE is occurring in engineering contexts, including cross-border programs. GAI possesses the capacity to transform TNE by revolutionizing talent development, reformulating engineering models, and facilitating scientific assessment across multinational frameworks. However, problems like the generative illusion, ethical and ideological risks, lack of trust between teachers and students, and new threats to TNE in engineering equity in global settings require substantial focus. This study examines these concerns and outlines potential strategies to leverage GAI for transnational education in engineering, offering stakeholders the opportunity to prioritize AI literacy among educators and learners. This work emphasizes that cross-disciplinary and collaborative R&amp;D, following national and international standards, should tackle application hurdles while guaranteeing safety and inclusion. This study also addresses several future directions that can contribute to creating a unified framework and cost-effective solutions. These solutions, integrated with platforms like the National Smart Education Platform, can bridge digital divides, ensuring equitable access and enabling global TNE stakeholders to capitalize on the GAI revolution.

"Developing teamwork skills and creativity is becoming increasingly important in higher education. Brainstorming activities can support the acquisition of such transversal skills by encouraging open dialogue in collaborative design processes. In a successful brainstorming, participants propose diverse ideas, combine them, and elaborate new propositions by taking inspiration in the propositions of their teammates. However, the cognitive effect of idea fixation may hinder this process. Idea fixations happens when participants focus on a limited set of ideas and are unable to think about unrelated alternatives. This effect lowers the creativity of the group and prevents the participants to consider diverse aspects of the problem at hand, which is an important mechanism in design-based learning. Leveraging the recent development in Large Language Models (LLM), we propose to integrate a Generative-AI agent to introduce new ideas into a brainstorming process supported by a digital application. Such agent can be designed to bring new topics to be considered that the students may not have brought up themselves. Our study aims to examine how such AI-generated ideas may influence the ideas proposed anonymously by the participants, and ultimately, the outcome of the activity. We use a quasi-experimental design with two conditions: one in which only the students generate ideas (control), another where they receive AI-generated ideas along with their own. We conduct this experiment as a part of a design thinking project carried out by computer science students. Using a qualitative coding combined with Epistemic Network Analysis, we investigate the dissemination of the topics brought by the Generative-AI agent within the ideas of the participants. We also present and discuss practical aspects of the intervention and its implementation by educators in their teaching. Our findings are contributing to the understanding of humanAI interactions in the context of collaborative ideation in educational settings. They can inform the design of new interaction mechanisms with AI agents to support creativity. Furthermore, by introducing previously unconsidered topics to these activities, these AI-based agents can support groups of students in considering a wider range of aspects of the matter at hand, supporting the development of critical thinking. These mechanisms may be useful to educators and facilitators looking for solutions to overcome idea fixation and increase creativity in brainstorming.","La Scala, Jeremy; Sahli, Sonia; Gillet, Denis",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016340,dhkydsfrq5,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Hands; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Heuristic algorithms; Large language models; Network analyzers; Encoding; Teamwork; Particle swarm optimization; Engineering education; Creativity; human-<mark>AI</mark> collaboration; design thinking; critical thinking; ideation; epistemic network analysis,Stimulating Brainstorming Activities with Generative AI in Higher Education,
"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is profoundly reshaping the educational ecosystem, driving the transition of education into a new era characterized by ""human-machine"" collaborative evolution. In this context, cultivating innovative talents with ""machine-irreplaceable"" capabilities has become increasingly imperative, as critical thinking, creativity, and related competencies are now regarded as essential attributes for college students in the intelligent era. Nevertheless, the impact of GAI on students' creativity remains a subject of debate within academia, with no consensus on whether it enhances or undermines creative potential. To address this gap, this study investigated the influence of the generative AI tool Kimi AI on creativity among 113 college students, utilizing a single-factor between-subjects experimental design. Creativity was operationalized through scores obtained from an alien-drawing task, a widely recognized measure of divergent thinking. The results demonstrate that GAI, when employed as a ""learning companion,"" facilitates sustained interaction with students, thereby effectively fostering the development of their creative abilities.

This study employs a questionnaire survey to investigate the current status of autonomous learning among university students in Anhui Province during the AI era. It reveals prevalent issues such as exogenous learning motivation, inefficient strategy execution, and inadequate reflection mechanisms. Based on Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model, three-stage application strategies are proposed: activating learning interest and establishing personalized learning paths in the forethought stage; recommending intelligent learning resources and adjusting learning strategies in the performance stage; and evaluating autonomous learning effects and reflecting on the learning process in the self-reflection stage. To validate the effectiveness of these strategies, a controlled experiment and qualitative interviews were designed. The research confirms that GAI-enabled application strategies for autonomous learning can provide personalized guidance and support to university students, enhancing their autonomous learning outcomes.","Zhao, Sijia; Tao, Jia",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11091906,yvadqa2aer,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,649,644,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Surveys; Computer science; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Chatbots; Reflection; Interviews; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; independent learning; college students",Research on the Application Strategy of Generative Artificial Intelligence Empowering College Students' Independent Learning,

"As AI proceeds to continue its inevitable growth, the blossoming of deep fakes and AI-synthesized fake voices are beginning to pose significant challenges to the integrity of both audio and visual content on digital platforms. As technologies such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) become increasingly sophisticated, the demand to identify and mitigate the vulnerabilities within them becomes eminent. This study explores novel methodologies to uncover these vulnerabilities that are present in these fake voices and deep fakes. Through using existing techniques, such as a deep neural network (DNN), this research identifies potential weaknesses in the models underlying these technologies. With the knowledge of these weaknesses, the aim is to enhance the robustness of systems that may be prone to manipulation and deception by giving them the ability to both detect and exploit the vulnerabilities in AI-synthesized content to expose the fake from the real. Ultimately, these findings are for the purpose of contributing towards the ongoing efforts to safeguard the integrity and authenticity of multimedia content in the digital age.","Wakene, Geda; Chen, Zizhao; Wong, W.

"Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) provides a ubiquitous coverage to user equipments (UEs) but it is also susceptible to interference. Rate-splitting (RS) effectively extracts data by decoding interference, yet its effectiveness is limited by the weakest UE. In this paper, we investigate an RS-based CF massive MIMO system, which combines strengths and mitigates weaknesses of both approaches. Considering imperfect channel state information (CSI) resulting from both pilot contamination and noise, we derive a closed-form expression for the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system under a spatially correlated Rician channel. Moreover, we propose low-complexity heuristic algorithms based on statistical CSI for power-splitting of common messages and power-control of private messages, and genetic algorithm is adopted as a solution for upper bound performance. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem, aiming to maximize the sum SE of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system by optimizing the power-splitting factor and power-control coefficient. Importantly, we improve a generative AI (GAI) algorithm to address this complex and non-convexity problem by using a diffusion model to obtain solutions. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in mitigating interference, especially in dynamic environments.","Zheng, J.; Zhang, J.; Du, H.; Zhang, R.; Niyato, D.; Dobre, O.A.; <mark>Ai</mark>, B.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCOMM.2024.3469542,hdspcho6cv,,,4,"IEEE Transactions on Communications, Communications, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"The rapid adoption of Generative AI across multiple use cases has introduced new risks and attack surfaces across a range of important applications. While the increasing competency of Large Language Models (LLMs) promises high value, responsible AI requires the mitigation of potentially biased, brittle, and baroque operations which undermine trust and carry the potential of causing harm. Moreover, active adversaries will exploit LLM weaknesses to undermine confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Encompassing a survey of current LLM performance and risk literature, this paper presents a framework for understanding the current state of the art and a complementary path forward. In particular, the framework enables designers, users, and policymakers to understand and assess categorized risks and suggests methods to mitigate weaknesses during design and deployment in order to create LLMs that are less likely to fail and more resilient to attacks. It also suggests methods to use existing but imperfect LLMs in a responsible manner.","Maybury, Mark",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICAD65464.2025.11114038,revggbvgvf,,,,"2025 IEEE International Conference on <mark>AI</mark> and Data Analytics (ICAD), <mark>AI</mark> and Data Analytics (ICAD), 2025 IEEE International Conference on",,7,1,,True,20250624,IEEE,Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Surveys; Data analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Prevention and mitigation; Large language models; Security; Resilience; LLM; vulnerability; security; resilience,"Mitigating Biased, Brittle and Baroque Generative AI",
"This paper presents an innovative solution to enhance the transportation experience of pilgrims during Hajj, focusing on the journey from Jeddah to the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah. Managing the transportation of millions of pilgrims within a constrained timeframe poses significant logistical challenges, often addressed using inefficient manual methods. Our approach integrates Generative AI for data extraction and retrieval, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for algorithmic optimization, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for real-time tracking. The system automates the allocation of pilgrims to buses, optimizing travel distances, reducing the number of buses required, and maximizing capacity utilization. Furthermore, a voice-enabled chat interface powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides real-time information access for both staff and pilgrims. Comparative evaluations reveal that our approach outperforms traditional methods, achieving over 40 times faster bus allocations and a 13% reduction in the number of buses required, leading to enhanced efficiency, resource utilization, and cost savings of an approximately 16 million Saudi Riyals in two months.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) present both significant business potential and substantial risks. This paper addresses the critical need for robust and scalable red teaming processes to identify and mitigate risks before LLM solution deployment. First, we define a comprehensive set of 48 LLM-associated risks reflecting emerging AI threats. Additionally, we introduce an automated adversarial prompt generation pipeline involving five types of generators that cover diverse AI risks at varying complexity levels. Finally, we implement a LLM-as-a-judge evaluation system to streamline testing. When applied to red-team two finance-based LLM applications, our approach achieved perfect recall in identifying failed outputs while reducing manual evaluation by over 90%. The developed features halved the time required for red teaming exercises, enhancing scalability and thoroughness while maintaining effectiveness.

"Most aerospace turbine casings are mechanised using a vertical lathe. This paper presents a tool wear monitoring system using computer vision that analyses tool inserts once that the machining process has been completed. By installing a camera in the robot magazine room and a tool cleaning device to remove chips and cooling residuals, a neat tool image can be acquired. A subsequent Deep Learning (DL) model classifies the tool as acceptable or not, avoiding the drawbacks of alternative computer vision algorithms based on edges, dedicated features etc. Such model was trained with a significantly reduced number of images, in order to minimise the costly process to acquire and classify images during production. This could be achieved by introducing a special lens and some generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This paper proposes two novel architectures: SCWGAN-GP, Scalable Condition Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Gradient Penalty, and Focal Stable Diffusion (FSD) model, with class injection and dedicated loss function, to artificially increase the number of images to train the DL model. In addition, a K|Lens special optics was used to get multiple views of the vertical lathe inserts as a means of further increase data augmentation by hardware with a reduced number of production samples. Given an initial dataset, the classification accuracy was increased from 80.0 % up to 96.0 % using the FSD model. We also found that using as low as 100 real images, our methodology can achieve up to 93.3 % accuracy. Using only 100 original images for each insert type and wear condition results in 93.3 % accuracy and up to 94.6 % if 200 images are used. This accuracy is considered to be within human inspector uncertainty for this use-case. Fine-tuning the FSD model, with nearly 1 billion training parameters, showed superior performance compared to the SCWGAN-GP model, with only 80 million parameters, besides of requiring less training samples to produced higher quality output images. Furthermore, the visualization of the output activation mapping confirms that the model takes a decision on the right image features. Time to create the dataset was reduced from 3 months to 2 days using generative AI. So our approach enables to create industrial dataset with minimum effort and significant time speed-up compared with the conventional approach of acquiring a large number of images that DL models usually requires to avoid over-fitting. Despite the good results, this methodology is only applicable to relatively simple cases, such as our inserts where the images are not complex.","Garcia-Perez, Alberto; Gomez-Silva, Maria Jose; de la Escalera-Hueso, Arturo",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1007/s10845-024-02379-2,35fxhkky6b,,,5,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,,3183,3165,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=35fxhkky6b&recordId=35fxhkky6b&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Springer Nature,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Transformer models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Stable Diffusion; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Computer vision,A Generative AI approach to improve in-situ vision tool wear monitoring with scarce data.,36
"The advent of Generative AI (GAI) tools such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot has significantly impacted higher education. This exploratory study investigates the current perspectives of lecturers in Human Resource Management (HRM) and Psychology on adapting assessment strategies in response to GAI developments. Through an online survey, qualitative data was collected from 12 academics, revealing a shift towards more authentic and process-oriented assessments. The findings highlight the dual role of GAI: while it poses risks to academic integrity, contrary to the common perception, it also offers opportunities to enhance assessment authenticity and student engagement. Participating educators reported various adaptations, including the integration of GAI into assessment tasks, increased use of group-based projects, and the implementation of time-limited and context-specific assignments. The study emphasises the need for continuous evolution in assessment practices to maintain academic integrity and effectively measure student learning outcomes in the GAI era.

"Protecting research integrity is crucial for maintaining trust in the scholarly record. Historically, threats to research integrity stemmed from deliberate human actions, such as data manipulation and misrepresentation. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly prevalent in higher education and is capable of generating research data and scholarly papers almost instantly. The immediate production of research data challenges traditional standards of academic rigor and integrity. The purpose of this study was to explore the role and impact of GAI on research integrity and the scholarly record, emphasizing the need for robust safeguards. For this study, we submitted Likert-type survey questions to GAI, specifically ChatGPT, and investigated how ChatGPT responded to the questions and generated quantitative and mixed-methods data that could be presented as human study participant responses. As GAI evolves, the academic community must address its potential misuse, particularly in research institutions where the pressure to ""publish or perish"" is pervasive. In the age of GAI, ensuring the accuracy and honesty of the scholarly record is imperative for the credibility of innovative and impactful research. Findings indicate that data integrity in higher education research may be at risk if institutions do not establish clear, enforceable guidelines and policies to mitigate the potential misuse of GAI.",Andrea Wilson; Cheryl Burleigh,ERIC,,,t4a246dcwf,,,,Journal of Educational Research and Practice,,,,,True,20250101,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Computer Software; Technology Integration; Accuracy; Likert Scales; Academic Standards; Difficulty Level; Faculty Publishing; Publish or Perish Issue; Integrity; Higher Education; Research; College Faculty; Questioning Techniques; Ethics; Scholarship,Research Integrity in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence,15
"Despite increasing calls for integrating generative AI (GAI) into education, individual teachers still show disparate attitudes and actions. It is thereby pivotal to understand the reasons behind such divergent responses. However, factors affecting teachers' uptake of GAI in their instruction, particularly their endorsement of students' engagement with such technology in instructed learning, remain under-explored. This study queried this topic by interviewing 17 language teachers teaching at 10 universities across China. Data analyses identified a range of specific factors underlying those teachers' decision to integrate GAI. The study also revealed that the motivating and inhibiting patterns behind teachers' personal engagement with GAI differed from those behind their endorsement of students' GAI use in teaching, suggesting that different dimensions of GAI integration into instruction may be influenced by different sets of factors, and thus may need to be treated separately in practical movement towards GAI integration.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies are gaining traction in higher education, offering potential benefits such as personalized learning support and enhanced productivity. However, successful integration requires understanding the factors influencing students' adoption of these emerging tools. This study investigates the determinants shaping higher education students' adoption of GAI through the lens of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 framework. Data was collected from Pyatigorsk State University students and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings reveal habit (HB) as the most influential predictor of GAI adoption among students, followed by performance expectancy. Hedonic motivation, social influence (SI), and price value positively influenced behavioral intention (BI) to use these technologies. Surprisingly, facilitating conditions (FCs) exhibited a negative effect on BI, suggesting potential gaps in support systems. The study identifies no significant gender differences in the underlying factors driving adoption. Based on the results, recommendations are provided to foster HB formation, communicate benefits, enhance hedonic appeal, leverage SI, address price concerns, and strengthen FCs. Potential limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data, geographic constraints, reliance on self-reported measures, and the lack of consideration for individual differences as moderators.

"Creativity is an imperative skill for today's learners, one that has important contributions to issues of inclusion and equity in education. Therefore, assessing creativity is of major importance in educational contexts. However, scoring creativity based on traditional tools suffers from subjectivity and is heavily time- and labour-consuming. This is indeed the case for the commonly used Alternative Uses Test (AUT), in which participants are asked to list as many different uses as possible for a daily object. The test measures divergent thinking (DT), which involves exploring multiple possible solutions in various semantic domains. This study leverages recent advancements in generative AI (GenAI) to automate the AUT scoring process, potentially increasing efficiency and objectivity. Using two validated models, we analyze the dynamics of creativity dimensions in a multi-step intervention aimed at improving creativity by using repeated AUT sessions (N=157 9th-grade students). Our research questions focus on the behavioural patterns of DT dimensions over time, their correlation with the number of practice opportunities, and the influence of response order on creativity scores. The results show improvement in fluency and flexibility, as a function of practice opportunities, as well as various correlations between DT dimensions. By automating the scoring process, this study aims to provide deeper insights into the development of creative skills over time and explore the capabilities of GenAI in educational assessments.

This opinion piece proposes an expanded theoretical framework for contextual learning, incorporating practical, situational, experiential, interdisciplinary, and ethical dimensions to address the limitations of authentic assessment in the face of GenAI's rapid advancements. Whilst the framework is primarily theoretical and not yet empirically validated, it offers a new way of thinking about assessment design, providing educators with a vocabulary and conceptual tools to create more resilient and effective assessments. Learning Developers, who often lead initiatives, engage in collaborative efforts, and support both educators and students, are particularly well-positioned to implement and advocate for these strategies. By integrating diverse contexts into assessment design, this framework aims to promote higher-order thinking and real-world applications, making assessments more adaptable to the complexities of modern professional environments.

"This study investigated pre-service teachers' (PTs) intentions to adopt generative AI (GenAI) tools in future classrooms by applying an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Participants were enrolled in multiple teacher-preparation programs within a single U.S. higher education institution. Through a structured GenAI-integrated activity using Khanmigo, a domain-specific AI platform for K-12 education, PTs explored AI-supported instructional tasks. Post-activity data were analyzed using PLS-SEM. The results showed that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease-of-use (PEU), and self-efficacy (SE) significantly predicted behavioral intention (BI) to adopt GenAI, with SE also influencing both PU and PEU. Conversely, personal innovativeness in IT and perceived cyber risk showed insignificant effects on BI or PU. The findings underscored the evolving dynamics of TAM constructs in GenAI contexts and highlighted the need to reconceptualize ease-of-use and risk within AI-mediated environments. Practically, the study emphasized the importance of preparing PTs not only to operate AI tools but also to critically interpret and co-design them. These insights inform both theoretical models and teacher education strategies, supporting the ethical and pedagogically meaningful integration of GenAI in K-12 education. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Liu, Yang; Wang, Qiu; Lei, Jing",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/bs15081040,55swtbhxwn,,,8,Behavioral Sciences (2076-328X),,,1040,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=55swtbhxwn&recordId=55swtbhxwn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Technology Acceptance Model; Teacher education; Perceived benefit; Student teachers; Preparedness; Educators; Self-efficacy; United States,Adopting Generative AI in Future Classrooms: A Study of Preservice Teachers' Intentions and Influencing Factors.,15
"Metal ions, as abundant and vital cofactors in numerous proteins, are crucial for enzymatic activities and protein interactions. Given their pivotal role and catalytic efficiency, accurately and efficiently identifying metal-binding sites is fundamental to elucidating their biological functions and has significant implications for protein engineering and drug discovery. To address this challenge, we present SuperMetal, a generative AI framework that leverages a score-based diffusion model coupled with a confidence model to predict metal-binding sites in proteins with high precision and efficiency. Using zinc ions as an example, SuperMetal outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving a precision of 94 % and coverage of 90 %, with zinc ions localization within 0.52 ± 0.55 Å of experimentally determined positions, thus marking a substantial advance in metal-binding site prediction. Furthermore, SuperMetal demonstrates rapid prediction capabilities (under 10 s for proteins with ∼ 2000 residues) and remains minimally affected by increases in protein size. Notably, SuperMetal does not require prior knowledge of the number of metal ions—unlike AlphaFold 3, which depends on this information. Additionally, SuperMetal can be readily adapted to other metal ions or repurposed as a probe framework to identify other types of binding sites, such as protein-binding pockets. Scientific contribution SuperMetal introduces a diffusion-based, SE(3)-equivariant generative model that places metal ions in proteins with 94 % precision, 90 % coverage, and sub-ångström (0.52 Å) accuracy in under 10 s, surpassing current methods and accelerating metal-aware protein engineering and drug discovery.","Lin, Xiaobo; Su, Zhaoqian; Liu, Yunchao; Liu, Jingxian; Kuang, Xiaohan; Cummings, Peter T.; Spencer-Smith, Jesse; Meiler, Jens",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1186/s13321-025-01038-9,kwvzwtec3f,,,1,Journal of Cheminformatics,,12,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=kwvzwtec3f&recordId=kwvzwtec3f&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250715,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Drug discovery; Zinc ions; Protein engineering; Metal ions; Research and Development in Biotechnology,SuperMetal: a generative AI framework for rapid and precise metal ion location prediction in proteins.,17

"In collaborative systems with complex tasks relying on distributed resources, trust evaluation of potential collaborators has emerged as an effective mechanism for task completion. However, due to the network dynamics and varying information gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and collect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a comprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust evaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of misaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task completion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages based on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion process, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant to that stage—leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By leveraging advanced incontext learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning capabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the collected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices deemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation. The framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy in trust evaluation.","Zhu, B.; Wang, X.; Zhang, L.; Shen, X.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MNET.2025.3582407,vcpe5y2yon,,,5,"IEEE Network, Network, IEEE",,50,44,,True,20250901,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Collaboration; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Security; Cognition; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Accuracy; Training; Reliability; Complexity theory; Servers; Collaborative system; LLM; Trust evaluation",Chain-of-Trust: A Progressive Trust Evaluation Framework Enabled by Generative AI,39
"The Internet of Health Monitoring (IoHM) plays a vital role in emergency medical package delivery (EMPD) by enabling real-time monitoring and transmission of critical health data through interconnected devices in 6G networks. Autonomous aerial vehicles (UAVs) act as aerial base stations (ABSs), facilitating data collection and transmission between GAI-IoHM devices and edge servers. This is crucial for efficient communication in 6G-enabled space-air–ground integrated networks (SAGINs). However, UAVs supporting EMPD face challenges related to limited energy and computational capacity, especially during task offloading to edge servers. To address these constraints, this article proposes the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into UAVs for intelligent policy learning, enabling adaptive decision-making, real-time diagnostics, and efficient path planning under uncertainty. We present a novel multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based joint optimization framework for cooperative task allocation, trajectory planning, and power management (CTATP) in a 6G-enabled SAGIN architecture. The problem is modeled as a partially observable markov decision process (POMDP) to capture dynamic and uncertain operational conditions. To solve this, we introduce the GAI-based deep deterministic double policy gradient (GAI-DD3PG) algorithm, which leverages a generative actor-network to learn adaptive, energy-efficient control policies from latent action spaces. Simulations in urban emergency scenarios with 10–20 UAVs demonstrate GAI-DD3PG’s efficacy. Compared to proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), multiagent federated reinforcement learning (MAFRL), and Greedy heuristics, GAI-DD3PG achieves a 20% energy reduction, 15% higher delivery success rate, 25% shorter trajectories, and 30% improved resource utilization. These results highlight its potential for reliable EMPD in complex 6G SAGIN environments.","Leranso Betalo, M.; Ullah, I.; Berhanu Tesema, F.; Wu, Z.; Li, J.; Bai, X.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2025.3579780,bxzqrhtuhb,,,17,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,35907,35890,,True,20250901,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Resource management; 6G mobile communication; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Real-time systems; Wireless sensor networks; Reliability; Energy efficiency; Adaptation models; Space-air-ground integrated networks; Optimization; Energy-efficient autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) operation; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (GAI); multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL); power optimization; space-air–ground integrated network; trajectory",Generative AI-Driven Multiagent DRL for Task Allocation in UAV-Assisted EMPD Within 6G-Enabled SAGIN Networks,12
"The rapid convergence of generative AI (GAI), neuro-symbolic reasoning, and quantum computing has redefined secure communication and networking. Owing to the massive amounts of data, the need for extensive computing power, and the necessity to find and mitigate threats in real-time, traditional security measures cannot keep up with changing cyber threats as the communication infrastructure becomes more complicated. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential of a GAI-enhanced neuro-symbolic quantum framework for building security systems that are strong, scalable, and self-sufficient. This method improves threat detection, encryption, and real-time adversarial defense by combining symbolic reasoning for logic, deep learning for pattern recognition, and quantum intelligence to accelerate computations.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and digital twin (DT) are advanced data processing and virtualization technologies to revolutionize communication networks. Thanks to the powerful data processing capabilities of GAI, integrating it into DT is a potential approach to construct an intelligent holistic virtualized network for better network management performance. To this end, we propose a GAI-driven DT (GDT) network architecture to enable intelligent closed-loop network management. In the architecture, various GAI models can empower DT status emulation, feature abstraction, and network decision-making. The interaction between GAI-based and model-based data processing can facilitate intelligent external and internal closed-loop network management. To further enhance network management performance, three potential approaches are proposed, i.e., model light-weighting, adaptive model selection, and data-model-driven network management.

"This paper introduces an innovative paradigm in interactive wireless networking, leveraging large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to dynamically align network configurations and transmission strategies with user intents. Central to this paradigm is a “human-in-the-loop” framework that incorporates two pivotal processes: intent alignment with the network and streamlined user interaction. Existing quality of experience (QoE) modeling methodologies often suffer from a weak correlation between user intent and network adjustments. To address this, we review intent consistency in QoE modeling, utilizing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and advanced prompt engineering to seamlessly integrate human intent into network configurations. Surrounding our paradigm, we provide a comprehensive survey on a multi-layered integration that spans the application, intent, semantic, network, and transmission layers, seamlessly translating user intent into optimized networking and communication outcomes. We investigate key technologies such as semantic communication and GenAI-enabled transmission and networking for pioneering applications, which allow for the real-time understanding and execution of high-layer intents, enabling the integration of user intents with wireless networks. Additionally, we explore cloud-edge-device collaboration within our paradigm, which distributes computational and semantic tasks across the network infrastructure to enable low-latency, scalable, and intelligent interactions.

"The booming usage of Electric Vehicles (EV) led to the augmentation of Lithium-Ion batteries. This is due to its charging speed, ease of maintenance, lower operational cost, and high specific energy. Yet, these batteries are under scrutiny due to the significant amount of fire accidents in recent years. These accidents result from thermal runaway, a chain reaction that may lead to a catastrophic explosion. Approximately 60% of EV battery fire incidents stem from internal thermal runaway while charging accidents account for 30%. This paper envisages an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach for early prediction of fire in Li-ion batteries by quantitatively analyzing the volume of gases released during venting. The methodology is based upon previous research conducted and employs a dataset curated from previous studies to serve as a benchmark. Generative AI (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) is used to generate synthetic data samples. The validity of the dataset has been rigorously verified using Kernal Density plots, ensuring its reliability for predictive modeling. The random forest algorithm proves its efficacy and can predict the time before the thermal runaway to alert the user. Performance evaluation metrics, including 97.83% accuracy, 96.97% precision, 98.63% recall, and a 97.8% F1 score, highlight its robustness.

"IoT is one of the most efficient tools for real-time monitoring of various systems. However, faulty sensors, unreliable communication, interference, and synchronization issues often result in significant missing data in IoT-based sensor systems. This missing data leads to considerable performance degradation and inaccuracies in data analytics.

"Design of RF and mmWave circuits and electromagnetic (EM) structures is typically a designer experience-driven process, aided with time and resource-intensive simulations, iterative design methods, and ad-hoc optimization. The starting points of this process are some preselected parameterized templates that can limit the design space and achievable performance and functionalities. While there are templates that exist for simpler EM structures operable over a narrow range of frequencies (such as simple matching networks, symmetrical power dividers, etc.), for many structures that require more complex spectral responses, there are no set templates. This paper presents a generative AI approach toward rapid synthesis of arbitrary shaped EM structures with designer scattering parameters (S-parameters) utilizing a directed diffusion approach. While these models have been extremely successful in generating complex images, we show for the first time the diffusion model for synthesis of EM structures (represented as images), allowing search space of arbitrary shaped structures. Compared to traditional genetic algorithms, we demonstrate design convergence in seconds. Even compared with prior works with predictive AI models, generative AI approach reduces design time by at least $\sim 10$ times. Since diffusion models are known to unearth a much richer design space compared to generative adversarial networks and variational encoders, we believe that this can open up a new dimension for generative AI approaches towards EM and circuit synthesis.","Guo, Yingqing; Karahan, Emir Ali; Li, Zihao; Shao, Zijian; Zhang, Zaixi; Wang, Mengdi; Sengupta, Kaushik",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/IMS40360.2025.11103838,rkekwv3qyj,,,,"2025 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium - IMS 2025, Microwave Symposium - IMS 2025, 2025 IEEE/MTT-S International",,929,926,,True,20250615,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Photonics and Electrooptics; Radio frequency; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Noise; Diffusion models; Radiofrequency integrated circuits; Space exploration; Scattering parameters; Circuit synthesis; Millimeter wave communication; Integrated circuit modeling; design automation; diffusion models; filters; inverse design; machine learning; mmWave",Dall-EM: Generative AI with Diffusion Models for New Design Space Discovery and Target-To-Electromagnetic Structure Synthesis,
"Generative AI is transforming the way people accomplish tasks, reshaping numerous industries and workflows. In this study, we focus on one of the most popular applications of generative AI: text-to-image generation, a technology that gained significant attention in 2021. Despite its popularity, even after three years, text-to-image generation remains less efficient and slower on edge devices like mobile phones compared to its web-based counterparts. This research investigates various model variations and analyzes the factors influencing inference speed in image generation. While Mobile Diffusion, though not yet commercially available, claims to achieve an impressive inference speed of 0.02 seconds, we explore whether architectural modifications and sampling techniques can further enhance performance without compromising image quality. Our findings indicate that adjustments to sampling operations, such as switching the scheduler from PNDMS to DDIM, resulted in a 6.57% increase in inference speed, albeit with a slight degradation in FID and CLIP scores. In contrast, architectural changes yielded significant improvements, achieving up to a 15.24% increase in speed while maintaining favorable results in FID and CLIP scores.","Pardesi, Sonal Deepak; Muntean, Cristina Hava; Simiscuka, Anderson Augusto",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/BMSB65076.2025.11165718,7io7pzwgh5,,,,"2025 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB), Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB), 2025 IEEE International Symposium on",,6,1,,True,20250611,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Image quality; Industries; Degradation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Image synthesis; Image edge detection; Text to image; Switches; Mobile handsets; Multimedia communication; GANs; text-to-image",Pixelating to the Edge: Generative AI Art on Edge Devices,

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), e.g., diffusion model is recognized as a promising paradigm for enhancing intelligent transportation systems in vehicular networks. However, the existing implementation of GAI in vehicular networks is limited due to the massive data requirements of GAI and the considerable resources for model training, particularly in distributed vehicular network environments. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling distributed collaborative training for GAI. Therefore, in this paper we present an FL-empowered diffusion model training scheme for vehicular networks. Specifically, first, a novel utility evaluation model based on local model training accuracy is designed to assess the contribution of each vehicle's local model. The interactions between the edge computing servers and vehicles are modeled using a Stackelberg game, while a non-cooperative game determines the optimal strategy among vehicles. To account for the heterogeneity of vehicles and the uncertainty of associated risks, we incorporate prospect theory (PT) to represent subjective utility. Afterward, a backward induction mechanism is devised to determine the Stackelberg equilibrium for deriving the optimal decisions of edge computing servers and vehicles. Finally, simulations are conducted to illustrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves the sum utility rate in comparison to other baseline schemes.","Jiang, Haoqing; Su, Zhou; Xu, Qichao; Qi, Yihao; Dai, Minghui; Fang, Dongfeng",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICC52391.2025.11161518,srd56rqf7f,,,,"ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on Communications, Communications, ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on",,541,536,,True,20250608,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Engineering Profession; Training; Uncertainty; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Federated learning; Computational modeling; Collaboration; Games; Diffusion models; Servers; Edge computing; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (GAI); vehicles network; federated learning (FL); Stackelberg game; prospect theory (PT)",Federated-Learning-Empowered Distribution Training for Generative Artificial Intelligence in Vehicular Networks,

"Given the imminent introduction of Reduced Capability (RedCap) devices in 5G networks, the computational and communications limitations of these devices note new challenges for network slicing. Adaptive network slicing is required to optimize resource allocation and to maintain quality of service (QoS) across the wide variety of scenarios encountered in RedCap use cases. Finally Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a promising way forward: we use it to predict network conditions, effect automatic slice reconfiguration, and govern flexible resource distribution. In this paper, we look into the handicap of genai models such as generative opposition networks (GANS) and variationally autoencoders (VAEs) assisted network slicing for RedCap enabled 5G networks. Synthetic network traffic patterns can be created by GenAI, allowing it to forecast congestion and adjust slice parameters ahead of time on the basis of what it has learned. A reinforcement learning-driven network model lends itself to real-time decision-making, which will improve spectral efficiency, lowers delays, and will result in optimized power consumption. This paper presents a framework that applies GenAI to handle slice elasticity. If network conditions were changing, be in the future or in the middle of a task, this would ensure the operation of services with minimal interruption. The method was evaluated by simulation and found to be successful in dynamically balancing traffic loads and maintaining QoS levels in RedCap scenarios.

"This paper deals with data pseudonymization when using generative artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT. The aim of the research was to experimentally verify whether ChatGPT can maintain the protection of pseudonymized data by not maintaining the link between the anonymized part and personal data. Four requests were tested in the experiment, in which ChatGPT was gradually provided with various combinations of pseudonymized and complete data about customers and their orders. The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the use of ChatGPT when processing pseudonymized data does not pose a risk of violating the protection of personal data. This research seeks to contribute to the discussion on the security of generative artificial intelligence in processing sensitive data and confirms the effectiveness of pseudonymization as a mechanism for protecting personal data.","Kniezova, Jaroslava; Hrkut, Patrik; Krsak, Emil",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.23919/FRUCT65909.2025.11008283,j7fkqv6juz,,,,"2025 37th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT), Open Innovations Association (FRUCT), 2025 37th Conference of",,121,116,,True,20250514,FRUCT Oy,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Geoscience; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Chatbots; Security; Protection",Data Pseudonymization in the Generative Artificial Intelligence Environment,
"Intent-Based Networking (IBN) promises to redefine network management by automating operations to align with high-level user intents. The advent of powerful Generative AI (GenAI) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), could significantly accelerate this transformation. However, cur-rent research remains narrowly focused on LLM-based intent translation, leaving substantial gaps in understanding how GenAI can be applied across the entire IBN life cycle. This paper aims to bridge these gaps by investigating the wider potential of Generative AI (GenAI) in areas like intent orchestration, moni-toring, compliance assessment, and automated actions. Through a systematic categorization of tasks based on GenAI's suitability and the presentation of a practical use case, this work highlights the critical need for more comprehensive research to fully harness the potential of GenAI in advancing IBN.","Ficzere, Daniel; Hollosi, Gergely; Varga, Pal",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/NOMS57970.2025.11073701,mf7ppl7taf,,,,"NOMS 2025-2025 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium, Network Operations and Management Symposium, NOMS 2025-2025 IEEE",,7,1,,True,20250512,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; Bridges; Translation; Systematics; Automation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; intent-based networking; LLM; network automation",Beyond Intent Translation: Research Gaps in the Application of Generative AI for Intent-Based Networking,
"The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) among teenagers has led to significant misuse and safety concerns. To identify risks and understand parental controls challenges, we conducted a content analysis on Reddit and interviewed 20 participants (seven teenagers and 13 parents). Our study reveals a significant gap in parental awareness of the extensive ways children use GAI, such as interacting with character-based chatbots for emotional support or engaging in virtual relationships. Parents and children report differing perceptions of risks associated with GAI. Parents primarily express concerns about data collection, misinformation, and exposure to inappropriate content. In contrast, teenagers are more concerned about becoming addicted to virtual relationships with GAI, the potential misuse of GAI to spread harmful content in social groups, and the invasion of privacy due to unauthorized use of their personal data in GAI applications. The absence of parental control features on GAI platforms forces parents to rely on system-built controls, manually check histories, share accounts, and engage in active mediation. Despite these efforts, parents struggle to grasp the full spectrum of GAI-related risks and to perform effective real-time monitoring, mediation, and education. We provide design recommendations to improve parent-child communication and enhance the safety of GAI use.","Yu, Yaman; Sharma, Tanusree; Hu, Melinda; Wang, Justin; Wang, Yang",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SP61157.2025.00090,dbslxvsntz,,,,"2025 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), Security and Privacy (SP), 2025 IEEE Symposium on, SP",,2752,2735,,True,20250512,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Content management; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Social networking (online); Social groups; Control systems; Chatbots; Real-time systems; Safety; Security; Mediation; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (gai); teenagers safety; parental controls; safety concerns in gai; <mark>ai</mark> ethics; responsible <mark>ai</mark>,"Exploring Parent-Child Perceptions on Safety in Generative AI: Concerns, Mitigation Strategies, and Design Implications",
"Generative AI coding tools are relatively new and their impact on developers extends beyond traditional coding metrics, influencing beliefs about work and developers' roles in the workplace. This study aims to illuminate developers' preexisting beliefs about generative AI tools, their self-perceptions, and how regular use of these tools may alter these beliefs. Using a mixed methods approach, including surveys, a randomized controlled trial, and a three-week diary study, we explored the real-world application of generative AI tools within a large multinational software company. We found that the introduction and sustained use of generative AI coding tools significantly increases developers' perceptions of these tools as both useful and enjoyable. However, developers' views on the trustworthiness of AI-generated code remained unchanged. We also discovered unexpected uses of these tools, such as replacing web search and fostering creative ideation. Additionally, 84% of participants reported positive changes in their daily work practices, and 66% noted shifts in their feelings about their work, ranging from increased enthusiasm to heightened awareness of the need to stay current with technology.

"The increasing complexity of today’s industrial landscape poses a significant challenge for engineering education, creating a vast gap between the skills acquired by the students, the topics covered in the universities, and the skills required as per current industry demands. As the industry increasingly seeks to hire candidates with technical ability and the required skill set to solve real-world problems, traditional education and recruitment approaches struggle to keep up with the requirements. This misalignment is particularly evident in computer science and engineering, which is prone to rapid transformations, thus demanding an equally dynamic ecosystem. Generative AI (Gen AI), a subset of Artificial Intelligence, shows great promise in bridging the gaps between the three stakeholders: students, universities, and industry.

Through the presented framework, it becomes apparent that the ethical use of GAI models will also require developers to implement specific network architectures. However, the joint interaction will greatly promote transparency in the creative process, support fair monetization of a student's intellectual property, and facilitate the development of high-quality training datasets for future GAI models.

"The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has been met with a mix of reactions by higher education institutions, ranging from consternation and resistance to whole-hearted acceptance. Previous work has looked at the discourse and policies adopted by universities across the U.S. as well as educators, along with the inclusion of GenAI-related content and topics in higher education. Building on previous research, this study reports findings from a survey of engineering educators on their use of and perspectives toward generative AI. Specifically, we surveyed 98 educators from engineering, computer science, and education who participated in a workshop on GenAI in Engineering Education to learn about their perspectives on using these tools for teaching and research. We asked them about their use of and comfort with GenAI, their overall perspectives on GenAI, the challenges and potential harms of using it for teaching, learning, and research, and examined whether their approach to using and integrating GenAI in their classroom influenced their experiences with GenAI and perceptions of it. Consistent with other research in GenAI education, we found that while the majority of participants were somewhat familiar with GenAI, reported use varied considerably. We found that educators harbored mostly hopeful and positive views about the potential of GenAI. We also found that those who engaged more with their students on the topic of GenAI, both as communi-cators (those who spoke directly with their students) and as incorporators (those who included it in their syllabus), tend to be more positive about its contribution to learning, while also being more attuned to its potential abuses. These findings suggest that integrating and engaging with generative AI is essential to foster productive interactions between instructors and students around this technology. Our work ultimately contributes to the evolving discourse on GenAI use, integration, and avoidance within educational settings. Through exploratory quantitative research, we have identified specific areas for further investigation.","Dewan, Umama; Hingle, Ashish; McDonald, Nora; Johri, Aditya",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016518,xh7tei2qrf,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Surveys; Resistance; Computer science; Ethics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Shape; Conferences; Distance measurement; Engineering education; Lenses; teaching and research; higher education; engineering education,Engineering Educators' Perspectives on the Impact of Generative AI in Higher Education,
"Web frameworks have significantly changed how developers create web applications for the Internet. Thanks to pre-defined libraries, these frameworks not only accelerate development time but also reduce the amount of code developers need to write. However, to get the most out of the frameworks and libraries, developers need to have a deep understanding of core web programming languages. This allows them to write efficient code, troubleshoot effectively, and push the boundaries of what the frameworks can achieve. The same principle applies to Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, as they have the potential to enhance a developer's toolkit. However, they will only be useful if the developer has sound fundamental knowledge to verify the output from these tools. Educators in higher education face a similar predicament with the widespread use of Generative AI tools by learners. Many learners rely on these tools as a go-to solution without being able to verify or fully comprehend the output, leading to shallow understanding. The work in this paper outlines an approach used in a first-year web programming module within the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, where learners were encouraged to use Generative AI tools to stimulate critical thinking when conducting assessments. Specifically, GitHub CoPilot was used as a pair programmer, and ChatGPT served as a peer reviewer. In this context, the peer reviewer's role was to help the learner reflect on the tool's output. The aim of this study was to explore the design of active learning activities that incorporate Generative AI tools for web programming to foster critical thinking practices among learners. To evaluate our approach, we employed a critical thinking self-evaluation questionnaire instrument, where learners' opinions and customs were surveyed before and after both of the assignments.","Naeem, Usman; Styve, Arne; Virkki, Outi T.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016298,v7stbt2lxj,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,7,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Codes; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Instruments; Active learning; Chatbots; Libraries; Internet; Programming profession; Faces; Software development management; critical thinking; ChatGPT; GitHub CoPilot; web programming,Stimulating Critical Thinking in a Web Programming Module with Generative AI Tools,
"The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in smart microgrids introduces challenges related to demand-supply balance, energy forecasting accuracy, and optimal energy distribution. This paper proposes an AI-driven energy optimization framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the efficiency and reliability of smart microgrids. Unlike traditional optimization methods, GANs leverage adversarial learning to generate highly accurate energy demand forecasts and improve real-time energy dispatch. The proposed method was tested on a real-world smart microgrid dataset, integrating solar PV, wind turbines, and battery storage systems. Results demonstrate that the GAN-based approach improves energy demand prediction accuracy by 24.7% compared to conventional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and reduces energy storage inefficiencies by 14.8%. Furthermore, the optimization model enhances grid stability, achieving a 9.6% reduction in voltage fluctuations and a 12.3% decrease in peak load stress, thereby increasing overall microgrid efficiency. These improvements contribute to better energy sustainability, reduced operational costs, and enhanced grid resilience.

"Digital literacy plays an important role in teachers’ professional competence, especially in the context of digital transformation in education. With the advancement of digital technology, enhancing learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy has become a key step in literacy development. On this basis, this study employed the response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate various test indicators, including the number of words, number of answer points, and number of follow-up rounds, and evaluation indicators, including accuracy, expansion, and awareness, for generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A four-step process was followed that includes basic analysis of experiment results, factor estimation and variance analysis, multifactor response surface analysis, and indicator analysis. The findings indicate that the test factors related to the GAI-generated content had a significant impact on participants’ high awareness levels. These factors exhibited interactive effects, and the response surface model revealed an optimal approach for applying GAI to enhance awareness. Building on these insights, practical suggestions are proposed for using GAI to enhance digital literacy. On the basis of the research conclusions, practical approaches to applying GAI to enhance high awareness ability in digital literacy are proposed. These approaches include employing the critical point perturbation mechanism, role-oriented mechanism, and high awareness thinking chain mechanism.

An inductive approach was employed to identify five distinct categories of questions: understanding, knowledge, content, language, and train. The findings revealed that students were more likely to seek assistance from GenAI in the understanding category during academic writing. Moreover, no significant relationship was observed between the question categories and students' utilization or modification of GenAI responses. Overall, students found GenAI to be both useful and easy to use for academic writing, although lack of flexibility were noted. Based on these findings, the study aims to offer practical recommendations for enhancing the use of GenAI on students' academic writing.","Zhang, Xiaoxiao; Lu, Yao; Jia, Chengyuan; Jin, Linying; Shi, Yilu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11091942,2r2a67kyrz,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,576,572,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computer science; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Focusing; Writing; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> (GenAI); EFL academic writing; Questioning behavior; GenAI response utilization; GenAI response modification",Exploring the Use of Generative AI on Students’ Academic Writing: An Exploratory Study,
"This article examines the application of generative artificial intelligence in simulating virtual tourism experiences and its impact on tourist behavior in the postCOVID era. Utilizing advanced technologies such as Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, and WebXR, a system has been designed to create interactive virtual experiences of tourist destinations. A literature review reveals that both virtual experiences and generative AI hold significant potential in the tourism industry. However, few studies have explored how these two technologies can be combined and their impact on tourist behavior. Additionally, considering that generative AI, as a tool for simulating tourism experiences, significantly influences tourists' perception of destinations and attractions, travel intention, travel anxiety, and willingness to pay, studying generative AI and virtual tourism seems essential and important. Therefore, this study aims to review previous research and explore the impact of AI-based virtual tourism experiences on tourist behavior in the post-COVID era. Moreover, the study investigates factors influencing the effectiveness of these experiences and the moderating role of safety and health concerns. Results also show that perceived realism and interactivity of virtual experiences are key factors in the effectiveness of these experiences. This research provides a theoretical framework for understanding the influence of generative AI on tourism behavior and offers important practical implications for destination marketers and policymakers in the post-COVID tourism industry.","Basouli, Mehdi; Sheikhooni, Sahar",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICWR65219.2025.11006234,imk3uexpc5,,,,"2025 11th International Conference on Web Research (ICWR), Web Research (ICWR), 2025 11th International Conference on",,596,593,,True,20250416,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; COVID-19; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Tourism industry; Anxiety disorders; Transforms; Chatbots; Safety; Systematic literature review; Virtual Tourism; Post-COVID; WebXR; Destination Marketing",Application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Simulating Virtual Tourism Experiences: Examining the Impact on Post-COVID Tourist Behavior,
"As the global efforts to address climate change goals advance, the demand for renewable energy grows, and governments around the world actively promote low-carbon economies and green energy policies, the power system is undergoing profound changes. This transformation not only affects the mode of power production but also profoundly alters the way, focus, and technical means of power equipment asset management. The diversification of equipment types has increased management complexity, as new types of equipment such as photovoltaic inverters, wind turbine blades, and energy storage systems require specialized maintenance knowledge and technologies. To enhance the reliability and safety of power equipment, and reduce maintenance costs, this paper aims to explore the integration path of generative AI technology and the knowledge base of power equipment asset management, establish a knowledge base for the life cycle of asset equipment, adopt emerging generative AI information technology, and build an intelligent power asset equipment management question-answer platform to achieve intelligent management of various assets, thereby reducing unplanned downtime and improving the stability of power grid operation. Firstly, establish a knowledge base for power equipment management and combine it with the retrieval-augmented generation technology of generative AI to enable it to understand and generate professional knowledge and technical guidance related to power equipment. Then, deploy the application on a cloud platform and create an interactive intelligent assistant that can analyze emerging problems in real time and provide targeted solution suggestions. At the same time, it enables front-line technicians to quickly obtain effective help and support even when facing complex situations, they have never encountered before.","Qiu, Hui; Li, Zheng; Song, Weize",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ACPEE64358.2025.11040765,7hxsc43tfz,,,,"2025 10th Asia Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering (ACPEE), Power and Electrical Engineering (ACPEE), 2025 10th Asia Conference on",,166,161,,True,20250415,IEEE,"Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Costs; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Knowledge based systems; Retrieval augmented generation; Power system stability; Power grids; Asset management; Maintenance; Power system reliability; Safety; Asset equipment maintenance; intelligent assistant; retrieval-augmented generation",Generative AI Application in Power System Asset Management,
"Developing reliable healthcare AI models requires training with representative and diverse data. In imbalanced datasets, model performance tends to plateau on the more prevalent classes while remaining low on less common cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose DiffUltra, the first generative AI technique capable of synthesizing realistic Lung Ultrasound (LUS) images with extensive lesion variability. Specifically, we condition the generative AI by the introduced Lesion-anatomy Bank, which captures the lesion's structural and positional properties from real patient data to guide the image synthesis. We demonstrate that DiffUltra improves consolidation detection by 5.6% in AP compared to the models trained solely on real patient data. More importantly, DiffUltra increases data diversity and prevalence of rare cases, leading to a 25% AP improvement in detecting rare instances such as large lung consolidations, which make up only 10% of the dataset.","Chou, Yu-Cheng; Li, Gary Y.; Chen, Li; Zahiri, Mohsen; Balaraju, Naveen; Patil, Shubham; Hicks, Bryson; Schnittke, Nikolai; Parker, Maria; Kessler, David O.; Shupp, Jeffrey; Baloescu, Cristiana; Moore, Christopher; Gregory, Cynthia; Gregory, Kenton; Raju, Balasundar; Kruecker, Jochen; Chen, Alvin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ISBI60581.2025.10980728,qzofwuq735,,,,"2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on",,5,1,,True,20250414,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Photonics and Electrooptics; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Ultrasonic imaging; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Image synthesis; Lungs; Object detection; Data models; Lesions; Reliability; Synthetic data; Synthetic data training; conditional diffusion model; lung consolidation; Video object detection,Ultrasound Image Synthesis Using Generative AI for Lung Consolidation Detection,
"Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) facilitates the real-time optical contrast for in vivo biomedical imaging. However, the detection noise is an inevitable byproduct of the real-time imaging process. Additionally, fluorescent probes currently approved for clinical use remain limited within the wavelength of NIR-IIa (1000–1300 nm). NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) imaging has the potential to deliver higher resolution than NIR-IIa, but relies on toxic fluorescent probes not approved for human use. To support clinical high-precision imaging, we propose a NIR-II fluorescence enhanced imaging method based on perception-enhanced spectrum shift generative adversarial network with explainable AI systems (xAI-PSSGAN). The proposed method tackles the problem of limited unpaired data training, and generates NIR-IIb resembling images with enhanced resolution and reduced noise. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method effectively improves the imaging quality and surpasses competing alternatives, which is of great significance to promote the high-quality NIR-II imaging in clinical practice.","Fu, Lidan; Lu, Binchun; Li, Lingbing; Shi, Xiaojing; Tian, Jie; Hu, Zhenhua",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ISBI60581.2025.10980871,hx5vxkdytb,,,,"2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on",,4,1,,True,20250414,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Photonics and Electrooptics; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Image resolution; Explainable <mark>AI</mark>; Statistical analysis; Noise; Imaging; Fluorescence; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Real-time systems; Probes; Biomedical image enhancement; cycle-consistent <mark>generative</mark> adversarial network; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; explainability; NIR - II imaging,XAI-PSSGAN: Perception-Enhanced Spectrum Shift Generative Adversarial Network with Explainable AI System for NIR-II Fluorescence Molecular Imaging,

"This paper presents a biometric identification system based on tongue print recognition with the help of machine learning techniques. The system is named Generative-AI-based Interpretation of Human Ultrametrics and Analysis (GIHUA). Traditional biometric systems like fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans suffer the challenges of computational complexity, forgery risks and age-related changes. Tongue print, on the contrary has the advantages that it remains unchanged throughout the life of a person, unaffected by trauma or diseases and is very difficult to forge, due to difficulty in its acquisition without the awareness of the individual. Tongue-print based systems mostly rely on image-based dataset whereas this work focuses on a numerical dataset which contributes to computational efficiency. GIHUA uses ultrametric distances to extract the features and this makes it ideal for applying directly into any machine learning model, regardless of being linear or non-linear. To overcome the scarcity of labeled tongue-print datasets, GIHUA creates synthetic labels with the help of K-means clustering and generative AI-based data augmentation technique. Classification is performed using random forest algorithm. Results show an accuracy of 99.10%, promising tongue print as an additional or alternative approach to biometric identification.","S, Anju Latha Nair; Nair, Athira S.; Sudhakar, Sunjith",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICTEST64710.2025.11042382,s373ivflwz,,,,"2025 2nd International Conference on Trends in Engineering Systems and Technologies (ICTEST), Trends in Engineering Systems and Technologies (ICTEST), 2025 2nd International Conference on",,5,1,,True,20250403,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Tongue; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Semisupervised learning; Feature extraction; Biometric identification; Market research; Numerical models; Security; Random forests; Synthetic data; Tongue print identification; machine learning; semi-supervised learning; ultrametric distance; synthetic data; identity verification; security systems",Generative AI based Interpretation of Human Ultrametrics and Analysis,1
"This paper proposes a personalized learning path optimization algorithm based on GAN (GAN-LP). The algorithm automatically generates customized learning paths for each learner through adversarial training of the generator and the discriminator, and dynamically adjusts the learning content and sequence according to personalized characteristics such as learning progress, learner interests, and abilities, thereby optimizing the learning effect. The GAN-LP algorithm generates learning paths that meet the learner's personalized needs through the generator, while the discriminator evaluates whether the path is effective, and then continuously optimizes the performance of the generator through adversarial training. Using a real English learning dataset (including learners' historical scores, behavioral data, and learning progress), this paper compares GAN-LP with traditional rule-based learning path generation methods and algorithms based on recommendation systems. Experimental results show that GAN-LP is superior to other methods in terms of learning effect, learning efficiency, and learner satisfaction. Specifically, GAN-LP can improve learners' performance in terms of test scores and task completion time by about 20%, and improve learners' satisfaction by more than 15%. This study provides innovative ideas for the application of generative AI in the design of personalized learning paths, making full use of the generation and optimization capabilities of generative adversarial networks to improve the flexibility and adaptability of learning paths. This algorithm not only has broad application potential in the field of English learning, but also provides a feasible technical framework for the design of personalized learning paths in other fields.","Li, Hongxia; Liu, Yun",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICIPCA65645.2025.11138250,uiss3vgew5,,,,"2025 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Image Processing and Computer Applications (ICIPCA), Image Processing and Computer Applications (ICIPCA), 2025 IEEE 3rd International Conference on",,1114,1109,,True,20250628,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Heuristic algorithms; Image processing; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Generators; Real-time systems; Optimization; Recommender systems; Personalized learning path; <mark>generative</mark> adversarial network; optimization algorithm; intelligent education; learning effect",Research on Optimization Algorithm of Generative AI in Design of Personalized Learning Path for English,
"Vibe coding is a recent Generative AI innovation where a human operator provides conversational natural language description of a problem and an AI assistant writes the code to develop a solution. It is more than collaborating or assisting with coding, as the entirety of coding and technical implementation is delegated to the AI agent. Vibe coding presents an immediate productivity boost for prototype development, as it addresses the growing complexity of development tools, increased demand for time-efficient prototype development, and the shortage of skills needed to address this demand. This paper presents the role and contribution of vibe coding for prototyping industrial systems. The paper begins with an introduction to vibe coding and vibe coding tools, followed by a workflow comparison of conventional prototyping and vibe coding worked through a sample scenario of an industrial system prototype. A further productivity comparison of the two approaches across diverse dimensions of cognitive load, development speed, code quality, debugging and iteration is also reported. The paper concludes by highlighting the opportunities and risks of vibe coding, and a selection of best practices that can accelerate the adoption of vibe coding for prototyping industrial systems.","De Silva, Daswin; Mills, Nishan; Issadeen, Zafar; Moraliyage, Harsha; Jennings, Andrew; Manic, Milos",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ISIE62713.2025.11124737,ipoaou37zb,,,,"2025 IEEE 34th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE), Industrial Electronics (ISIE), 2025 IEEE 34th International Symposium on",,6,1,,True,20250620,IEEE,"Aerospace; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Transportation; Productivity; Technological innovation; Codes; Debugging; Tutorials; Syntactics; Cognitive load; Encoding; Complexity theory; Standards; vibe coding; <mark>AI</mark>-assisted Development; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Prototyping; Industrial Systems; Cognitive Load; Workflow Comparison",Generative AI Vibe Coding for Prototyping Industrial Systems,

"The increasing realism of images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) presents new challenges for digital literacy, particularly in distinguishing authentic content from synthetic creations. This paper presents the results of a public online quiz in which participants were asked to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs. Each of the ten questions featured a pair of images—one original photograph and one AI-generated version created based on a textual description of the original. With over a hundred responses collected, the average score was 5.79 out of 10, with a median of 6, suggesting moderate success but also highlighting the difficulty many users had in discerning AI-generated content. The distribution of results showed a wide range of performance, with most participants scoring between 4 and 8 points.

"6G's AI native vision of embedding advance intelligence in the network while bringing it closer to the user requires a systematic evaluation of Generative AI (GenAI) models on edge devices. Rapidly emerging solutions based on Open RAN (ORAN) and Network-in-aBox strongly advocate the use of low-cost, off-the-shelf components for simpler and efficient deployment, for example, in provisioning rural connectivity. In this context, conceptual architecture, hardware testbeds, and precise performance quantification of Large Language Models (LLMs) on off-theshelf edge devices remain largely unexplored. This research investigates computationally demanding LLM inference on a single commodity Raspberry Pi serving as an edge testbed for ORAN. We investigate various LLMs, including small, medium, and large models, on a Raspberry Pi 5 Cluster using a lightweight Kubernetes distribution (K3s) with modular prompting implementation. We study its feasibility and limitations by analyzing throughput, latency, accuracy, and efficiency. Our findings indicate that CPU-only deployment of lightweight models, such as Yi, Phi, and Llama3, can effectively support edge applications, achieving a generation throughput of 5 to 12 tokens per second with less than 50% CPU and RAM usage.

"This study investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated personalized images to address the underrepresentation of female students in university engineering programs and promote gender equality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Persistent gender disparities in STEM present significant barriers to diversity and innovation, highlighting the need for innovative strategies to inspire underrepresented groups. The research involved 76 high school students from scientific tracks, who were shown with AI-generated personalized images portraying themselves working in STEM-related professions. Results indicate that self-envisioning in STEM fields increased for both genders after the intervention, with the effect being four times greater for female students. In engineering fields specifically, a significant increase in selfenvisioning was observed among female students, while no significant impact was found for male students-likely due to the historical underrepresentation of women and the influence of gender stereotypes on career aspirations.

"Driven by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), generative AI applications have become the dominant workload for the modern cloud. Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs. AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties. Existing industry-standard CPU-based TEEs, such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV, do not adequately protect these accelerators. Device-TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side. On the other hand, existing academic proposals target specific CPU-TEE platforms. To address this gap, we propose Guardain,a confidential computing architecture for discrete NPU devices that requires no trust in the host system.

"Providing rich, constructive feedback to students is essential for supporting and enhancing their learning. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities to deliver scalable, repeatable, and instant feedback, effectively making abundant a resource that has historically been scarce and costly. From a technical perspective, this approach is now feasible due to breakthroughs in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the potential educational benefits are compelling, implementing these technologies also introduces a host of ethical considerations that must be thoughtfully addressed. One of the core advantages of AI systems is their ability to automate routine and mundane tasks, potentially freeing up human educators for more nuanced work. However, the ease of automation risks a “tyranny of the majority”, where the diverse needs of minority or unique learners are overlooked, as they may be harder to systematize and less straightforward to accommodate. Ensuring inclusivity and equity in AI-generated feedback, therefore, becomes a critical aspect of responsible AI implementation in education. The process of developing machine learning models that produce valuable, personalized, and authentic feedback also requires significant input from human domain experts. Decisions around whose expertise is incorporated, how it is captured, and when it is applied have profound implications for the relevance and quality of the resulting feedback. Additionally, the maintenance and continuous refinement of these models are necessary to adapt feedback to evolving contextual, theoretical, and student-related factors. Without ongoing adaptation, feedback risks becoming obsolete or mismatched with the current needs of diverse student populations. Addressing these challenges is essential not only for ethical integrity but also for building the operational trust needed to integrate AI-driven systems as valuable tools in contemporary education. Thoughtful planning and deliberate choices are needed to ensure that these solutions truly benefit all students, allowing AI to support an inclusive and dynamic learning environment.","Lindsay, Euan D; Zhang, Mike; Johri, Aditya; Bjerva, Johannes",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016572,7voyzo7dbn,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Ethics; Automation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Navigation; Machine learning; Turning; Planning; Maintenance; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Lenses; Educational Technology; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Natural Language Processing; Human-Computer Interaction,The Responsible Development of Automated Student Feedback with Generative AI,

"This study investigates the influence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) on university students' learning outcomes, employing a technology-mediated learning perspective. We developed and empirically tested an integrated model, grounded in interaction theory and technology-mediated learning theory, to examine the relationships between GAI interaction quality, GAI output quality, and learning outcomes. The model incorporates motivational factors (learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, and creative self-efficacy) as mediators and creative thinking as a moderator. Data from 323 Chinese university students, collected through a two-wave longitudinal survey, revealed that both GAI interaction quality and output quality positively influenced learning motivation and creative self-efficacy. Learning motivation significantly mediated the relationship between GAI output quality and learning outcomes. Furthermore, creative thinking moderated several pathways within the model, with some variations observed across the two time points. These findings provide theoretical and practical insights into the effective integration of GAI tools in higher education, highlighting the importance of both interaction and output quality in optimizing student learning experiences.","Bai, Yun; Wang, Shaofeng",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1038/s41598-025-08697-6,pqdvrybeiz,,,1,Scientific Reports,,16,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=pqdvrybeiz&recordId=pqdvrybeiz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250705,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Cognitive psychology; Chinese-speaking students; Creative thinking; Educational outcomes,Impact of generative AI interaction and output quality on university students' learning outcomes: a technology-mediated and motivation-driven approach.,15

We showcase the numerical performance of conditional DM using the accurate DeepMIMO channel datasets, revealing its superiority in generating high-fidelity channels and mitigating unforeseen distribution shifts in sophisticated scenes. Furthermore, several DM-driven communication management designs promising to deal with imperfect channels and task-oriented communications are conceived.

"The area of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly expanding, as seen by the regular release of new models and applications every few months. While these GenAI models have impressive capabilities, their computational intensity has presented issues, especially in applications demanding low latency. Hence, substantial research is being conducted to develop ways to scale down these models so that they may be used for on-device computing on edge devices. Examining successful examples of GenAI models implemented on mobile devices with minimum latency becomes critical in understanding the practical consequences of these breakthroughs. Notable instances, such as the deployment of diffusion-based GenAI models on flagship smartphones like Samsung S23 Ultra and iPhone 14, demonstrate the possibility and promise of bringing GenAI applications to consumers’ fingertips. We further analyze and find out the approaches and strategies that make these on-device deployments successful.","Sai, S.; Prasad, M.; Dashore, G.; Chamola, V.; Sikdar, B.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MCE.2024.3518761,qzyvoa27k5,,,4,"IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, Consumer Electronics Magazine, IEEE, IEEE Consumer Electron.

"This article explores the significance of various forms of fallibilism in the context of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in cartography. Fallibilism, as an epistemological approach, emphasizes the fundamental fallibility of knowledge (here particularly scientific knowledge and AI-generated knowledge) and calls for critical reflection on its limits and uncertainties. Five variants of fallibilism (epistemological, methodological, ontological, pragmatic, and neopragmatic) are examined in this context. The epistemological approach emphasizes the provisional nature of knowledge, while the methodological approach focuses on the need for error-tolerant methods. Ontological fallibilism questions fundamental assumptions about reality, and pragmatic and neopragmatic fallibilism emphasize the practical utility of knowledge and iterative development. The neopragmatic approach, which integrates all other perspectives, offers a flexible and practice-oriented framework. This framework promotes the creation of useful, dynamic, and inclusive cartographic applications. The article discusses how generative AI can be utilized within the neopragmatic framework of fallibilism to constructively address uncertainties and develop socially relevant solutions, particularly in the realm of cartography.","Edler, Dennis; Drews, Jule; Berr, Karsten; Kühne, Olaf",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s42489-025-00186-0,5jcn5c2fnn,,,2,KN - Journal of Cartography and Geographic Information: Kartographische Nachrichten,,135,123,,True,20250601,Springer International Publishing,Theoretical Cartography; Fallibilism; <mark>AI</mark>; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Uncertainty; Pragmatism; Neopragmatism; Epistemology; Ontology; Methodology; Philosophy of Science; Theoretische Kartographie; Fallibilismus; KI; <mark>Generative</mark> KI; Unsicherheit; Pragmatismus; Neopragmatismus; Epistemologie; Ontologie; Methodologie; Wissenschaftsphilosophie,Fallibilism and Generative AI in Cartography: Some Fundamental Theoretical Thoughts,75
"This study explores the instructional guidance provided to public relations practitioners on utilizing Generative AI (GenAI) following the public release of ChatGPT. We took a critical public relations approach to examine how thought leaders, bloggers, and scholars proposed integrating GenAI into public relations practice. Through a critical thematic analysis of 63 blog posts and news articles we sought to understand how instructional guides suggested integrating GenAI tools and the potential implications of these suggestions. We found that the examined texts primarily focused on how GenAI could enhance practitioners' efficiency, paying limited attention to the possible ethical implications of delegating public relations work to machines. We highlight potential ethical issues associated with GenAI taking over a significant portion of the writing tasks in public relations, and we argue that PR needs to develop alternative ways to utilize GenAI while preserving the unique contributions of human practitioners. We introduce the concept of participatory (AI) public relations, which emphasizes an ontological shift in how public relations understands and uses AI, where outcome is less important than the act of engaging in the practice of public relations.","Salzano, Matthew; Ashby-King, Drew T.",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/2046147X251320170,46a72t7ycn,,,2,Public Relations Inquiry,,246,221,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=46a72t7ycn&recordId=46a72t7ycn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250501,Sage Publications Inc.,Public relations; Participatory design; Public Relations Agencies; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; ChatGPT; Bloggers,Examining proposed generative AI integrations in public relations: Offering participatory (AI) public relations.,14
"This research examines the generative artificial intelligence's (AI) application systems on the analysis and reconstruction of architectural styles through the cultural integrity preservation lenses and design modification encouragement. The study constructs a framework for AI comprising feature extraction of architecture, semantic analysis and deep learning style diffusion reconstruction. The framework integrates historical and cultural contexts to evaluate architectural styles in three basic features domains: Assuming a multi-dimensional representation system of features architectural styles as developed structures assists in comprehension of the interrelations between architectural features. The research proposes and applies a new approach to semantic analysis directed towards understanding the construct description of an architectural style from a historical design preservation with a contemporary vision reinterpretation approach. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through case study investigations, comparative performance analysis, and expert appraisal, which attest to changes in style recognition up to 92.5% and design flexibility.

"With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Static, human-curated approaches such as MITRE ATT&amp;CK and CAPEC are often insufficient for companies to implement effective countermeasures, and security experts frequently face challenges in integrating these frameworks into their specific architectures. In this paper, we explore the application of generative AI to organize and enhance cybersecurity knowledge bases. We leverage multiple state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment an initial dataset of attackmitigation pairs, generating new countermeasures along with their prioritized execution order in a reasonable time frame. To evaluate the generated responses, we employ the LLM-as-aJudge technique. Evaluations with Claude 3.5, DeepSeek R1, and human oversight show that top-performing models on general benchmarks also perform well in this specialized task, with more than 70% of responses rated 4 and 5 out of 5 for correctness, and the weaker models tend to perform the worst. Additionally, we discuss the challenges of running LLMs with a larger number of parameters on less powerful hardware, where the performance of such models can degrade significantly, even performing worse than their smaller counterparts. In such cases, advanced prompt engineering becomes necessary to improve results.

"The demand for high-quality synthetic data for model training and augmentation has never been greater in medical imaging. However, current evaluations predominantly rely on computational metrics that fail to align with human expert recognition. This leads to synthetic images that may appear realistic numerically but lack clinical authenticity, posing significant challenges in ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of AI-driven medical tools. To address this gap, we introduce GazeVal, a practical framework that synergizes expert eye-tracking data with direct radiological evaluations to assess the quality of synthetic medical images. GazeVal leverages gaze patterns of radiologists as they provide a deeper understanding of how experts perceive and interact with synthetic data in different tasks (i.e., diagnostic or Turing tests). Experiments with sixteen radiologists revealed that 96.6 % of the generated images (by the most recent state-of-the-art AI algorithm) were identified as fake, demonstrating the limitations of generative AI in producing clinically accurate images.","Wong, David; Wang, Bin; Durak, Gorkem; Tliba, Marouane; Chaudhari, Akshay; Chetouani, Aladine; Cetin, Ahmet Enis; Topel, Cagdas; Gennaro, Nicolo; Vendrami, Camila Lopes; Trabzonlu, Tugce Agirlar; Rahsepar, Amir Ali; Perronne, Laetitia; Antalek, Matthew; Ozturk, Onural; Okur, Gokcan; Gordon, Andrew C.; Pyrros, Ayis; Miller, Frank H.; Borhani, Amir; Savas, Hatice; Hart, Eric; Torigian, Drew; Udupa, Jayaram K.; Krupinski, Elizabeth; Bagci, Ulas",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CVPRW67362.2025.00299,64lr57bmxf,,,,"2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on, CVPRW",,3166,3158,,True,20250611,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; Robotics and Control Systems; Measurement; Training; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Medical services; Data models; Medical diagnostic imaging; Standards; Synthetic data; Data Quality Evaluation; Synthetic Data; Eye Tracking; Diffusion Model; Visual Turing Test",Eyes Tell the Truth: Gaze Val Highlights Shortcomings of Generative AI in Medical Imaging,

"At present, badminton tactical training has problems such as single confrontation scenario and insufficient dynamic strategy generation. Traditional simulation methods rely too much on coaching experience and fixed playback videos, which is difficult to meet the needs of athletes’ personalized tactical awareness training and adaptive training in complex confrontation environments. In response to the above problems, this study proposes a tactical simulation and scenario training system based on generative AI. First, this paper constructs a multidimensional tactical knowledge graph and establishes a tactical ontology model including spatial trajectory, hitting mode, and confrontation strategy; secondly, a dynamic confrontation scenario generation module based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is developed. Finally, a tactical optimization engine driven by the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is designed to dynamically adjust the difficulty coefficient and strategy complexity of the generated scenarios. In the experiment, the athletes in the experimental group using the system achieved an accuracy rate of 85.4% in tactical prediction, which is significantly higher than the 75.1% of the control group; in terms of multi-shot connection error rate, the experimental group is 12.0 %,while the control group is17.2 %.

The Automated data Analyser is developed for such users who need automated data insights and machine learning model recommendations. It is built using python framework streamlit and uses google Gemini for generating the insights and suggesting machine learning algorithms for the given dataset. Initially the dataset is given as the only input nothing other input is needed as the system is automated it automatically pre-processes the data and generates the insightful data visualizations along with the descriptions. If the dataset is huge and contains more rows then the system uses dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the size of data and preserve the insights. By reducing the size of dataset using dimensionality reduction techniques it takes less time to analyse the dataset. It is an efficient system for huge data sets. The system is also capable to show the mathematical analysis of data to analyse the spread of data. To produce the data insights by Gemini LLM a small set of data along with prompt is given to LLM to generate the insights and recommendations.

However, concurrently fusing texts and images poses significant challenges, often struggling with the maintenance of text accuracy across languages, optimal placement, and appropriate typography. To address these challenges, we introduce the Multilingual Accurate Textual Image Customization (MATIC) framework. MATIC employs the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) concept to decompose the textual image generation process into multiple steps, leveraging diverse generative artificial intelligence, including Multimodal Large Language Model (MMLLM) and diffusion model. The framework first generates the desired text and a corresponding prompt for the diffusion model based on user input. The diffusiongenerated image is then examined to remove any undesired text. Meanwhile, the typographic elements are designed to align with the visual content. Finally, the textual image is fused with the aid of a grid coordinate system, evaluated by MMLLM, and further customized by the user through natural language.

"Developing problem-solving competency is central to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, yet translating this priority into effective approaches to problem-solving instruction and assessment has been a significant challenge. The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT in higher education introduces new considerations: how to define problem-solving competency in a genAI era, and how these tools can help or hinder students' development of STEM problem-solving competency. Our research takes steps in examining these considerations by studying how and why college students are currently using genAI tools in their STEM coursework, with a specific focus on how they employ these tools to support their problem-solving. We conducted an online survey of 40 STEM college students from diverse institutions across the US. In addition, we surveyed 28 STEM faculty to understand instructor views on effective and ineffective genAI tool use in STEM courses and their guidance for students. Our findings reveal high adoption rates and diverse applications of genAI tools among STEM students. The most common use cases of genAI tools in STEM coursework include finding explanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping with problem-set questions. The primary motivation for using genAI tools in STEM coursework was to save time. Moreover, we found that over half of the student participants reported simply inputting a problem for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their own problem-solving processes.

"Generative artificial intelligence has garnered significant interest in higher education, with growing concerns about its consequences for teaching, learning, and assessment. Educators are now faced with the task of adopting genAI into curricula in ways that are responsive to both the short- and long-term effects of this technological disruption on learning. This study considers these effects, focusing on the impacts of genAI on the intrinsic value of learning and its influences on shaping transformative encounters with knowledge in STEM curricula. The implications of incorporating genAI into outcomes and assessment tasks are examined using a constructivist approach based on taxonomies of cognitive skills involved in learning and STEM competency development namely, Bloom's and SOLO taxonomies, and Luckett's knowledge planes. The study offers insights into how the incorporation of genAI may influence conceptual knowledge building and the development of certain STEM graduate attributes and makes recommendations for teachers of STEM curricula.","Doorsamy, Wesley; Padayachee, Kershree; Cornell, Alan S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016322,nbs3myqvgr,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,5,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Knowledge engineering; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Taxonomy; Focusing; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Engineering education; STEM,Generative Artificial Intelligence and Encounters with Knowledge in STEM Higher Education Curricula,
"This study examines the relationship between the continuance use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and creativity among higher education students, emphasizing the mediating role of cognitive response. Drawing on the Expectation-Confirmation Model for Information Systems Continuance (ECM-ISC) and the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model, the research investigates how satisfaction, affect, and personality traits influence students’ intention to use AI tools and, through reflective cognitive engagement, enhance their creative performance. Data were collected from 288 undergraduate students via a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis. The findings indicate that while satisfaction, affect, and personality traits significantly boost the intention to use AI, this intention impacts creativity only indirectly through cognitive response. These results highlight the importance of reflective engagement in harnessing AI for creative tasks and offer insights for its balanced integration into educational settings.","Ping, Hongjie; Wang, Wei; Xie, Yingying; Lv, Shengnan; Li, Jielu; Weng, Lingling",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11092242,hvkdrphodz,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,621,615,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computer science; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Creativity; Information systems; Higher Education; Continuance Intention; Cognitive Response","Generative AI Dependency in Higher Education: Investigating Continuance Intention, Cognitive Response, and Creativity",
Existing security protocols encounter major cybersecurity difficulties because the online devices' growing popularity continues to spread across networks. These security protocols are ineffective because they do not properly handle current cyber threats. The main goal of this study involves developing enhanced IoT cybersecurity through the development of a threat detection system which brings together adversarial training and deep learning models (CNN-LSTM) and Federated Learning (FL). The system enables distributed Internet of Things devices to work on security model development through Federated Learning while maintaining total privacy of their information. Security procedures controlled by generative artificial intelligence robots alongside real-time attack protection functions decrease security response durations. Through its Federated CNN-LSTM model the system upholds a 1.2% false positive rate alongside a 98.3% accuracy evaluation and 160 milliseconds of exact threat tracking time. The designed system sustains a minimal occurrence of incorrect alarm activations. The developed system provides real-time security for the Internet of Things framework because it enables adaptive protection systems while preserving user privacy in current IoT settings.,"Srilakshmi, P; Chaganti, Koushik Reddy; Suryam, Talachendri; I, Sweety Julia; Chaithanya, D.; Kavitha, Jami",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICTMIM65579.2025.10988029,nroebldmfz,,,,"2025 5th International Conference on Trends in Material Science and Inventive Materials (ICTMIM), Trends in Material Science and Inventive Materials (ICTMIM), 2025 5th International Conference on",,1130,1124,,True,20250407,IEEE,"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Training; Privacy; Protocols; Federated learning; Real-time systems; Threat assessment; Internet of Things; Computer security; Protection; Robots; IoT cybersecurity; Machine learning; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; <mark>AI</mark>-driven threat detection; CNN-LSTM; Adversarial training; Real-time security; Edge computing",Real-Time IoT Cybersecurity using Machine Learning-based AI Threat Detection System to Train Generative Robots,

"This paper aims to find out how Generative AI models like GPT-3, when integrated with traditional teaching methods can enhance academic performance as well as the emotional well-being of students. Most of the digital education systems and tools only focus on curriculum delivery and fail to address the emotional states of students and their individual learning capabilities, this leads to the downfall of their academic progress and will yield poor learning outcomes. To address this issue, we have developed a system that analyzes the emotional states of students and then further categorizes them according to their learning pace (fast, medium, or slow). Our system works by first analyzing the survey responses collected from students using a scoring system that is predefined. Then it generates a personalized lesson plan tailored for each student according to the insights gained from the responses. With the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 for the Lesson plan generation we ensure the content generated will be tailored specifically for each student's needs. Furthermore, it has been observed that using learning strategies that use AI-driven technology can create a more supportive and flexible educational environment which results in the student having better comprehension, motivation and increases academic success.","Dhananjay, R.; Siddiqha, Rida; Raveendran, Nisha; Hegde, Vinayak",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.23919/INDIACom66777.2025.11115738,ws4f2wp6mf,,,,"2025 12th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom), Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom), 2025 12th International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250402,"Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi","Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Geoscience; Nuclear Engineering; Photonics and Electrooptics; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Transportation; Signal Processing and Analysis; Surveys; Sentiment analysis; Analytical models; Electronic learning; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Refining; Manuals; Online services; GPT-3; Emotional State; Learning Pace; Flipped Classroom; Education Technology",Analyzing the Emotional State of Students Using Generative Artificial Intelligence,
"Autism is the fastest-growing developmental condition, and as a spectrum disorder, individuals vary in severity in communication and behavior. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) presents opportunities to leverage such technology to support autistic individuals in multiple contexts, including education, healthcare, and disability research. However, very limited research has focused on developing AI or ML-based solutions for autistic individuals largely due to the scarcity of autism-related datasets. In order for autistic people to equally benefit from the breakthroughs in AI, the data representation gap in AI and ML must be addressed. The project proposes an innovative human expert and AI combined approach to generate synthetic data about autistic individuals. Through this approach, we are developing the first dataset of case studies of autistic individuals to effectively identify evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address the unique needs of autistic individuals. The project improves the representation and inclusion of autistic individuals in the rapidly evolving field of ML and AI through both methodological innovations (i.e., the expert/AI combined data generation approach) and practical contributions (i.e., the EBP dataset that will be made publicly accessible).

"Retinal imaging, like fundus photographs, is generally used to analyze eye conditions, where professionals like ophthalmologists review the images to identify signs of nerve damage or leakage, helping determine the severity of the disease. However, manual evaluation of such images can lead to errors due to human factors like fatigue and work stress. With advancements in technology, especially in artificial intelligence (AI), it is possible to reduce human-driven errors. AI-based solutions allow professionals to re-evaluate their analyses and facilitate early and accurate predictions. Computer vision-based AI can detect minute signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) that humans may miss, thereby improving overall accuracy and guiding the treatment in the right direction. Extensive research has been conducted, and various AI-based solutions have been developed to detect DR using various retinal imaging modalities. Since obtaining data from unhealthy individuals is challenging and expensive, an anomaly detection approach using healthy fundus images has been explored. To address these challenges, proposing a novel solution ViT-MAD (Vision Transformer Masked Anomaly Detector), a Vision Transformer-based method that leverages a similarity score model to accurately detect diabetic retinopathy in fundus images.

"Objective: The growing availability and sophistication of online generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, necessitates an exploration of their applications within the RANZCP Fellowship Training Program. This article examines how GenAI could be integrated into various areas, including trainee selection, workplace-based assessments, the Scholarly Project (SP), and the Psychotherapy Written Case (PWC). While GenAI offers benefits, trainees must understand that there are limitations on how these can be used with patient data. They should also be aware of the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the use of purpose-built medical scribe programs. For this paper, ChatGPT was employed to enhance language quality, without contributing to content generation. Conclusion: The accessibility and ease of use of GenAI present both opportunities and challenges. Given the limitations of AI detection software, the RANZCP will need to adapt to GenAI rather than attempt to regulate its use. Revisions to assessment methods, particularly those relying on written assignments, will be needed.

Specifically, we train a generative adversarial network to predict a channel realization in the time-frequency-space domain, in which the generator exploits the third-order moment of the input in its loss function and applies a new reparameterization method for latent distribution learning to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the true and estimated channel distributions. Next, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence mechanism to examine how the critic discriminates the generated channel. We demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior to existing methods in terms of minimizing estimation errors. Additionally, we find that the critic's attention focuses on the high-power portion of the channel's time-frequency representation.","Nguyen, Nghia Thinh; Do, Tri Nhu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICC52391.2025.11161627,gifj4r7prf,,,,"ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on Communications, Communications, ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on",,3784,3779,,True,20250608,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Engineering Profession; Training; Wireless communication; Time-frequency analysis; Estimation error; Explainable <mark>AI</mark>; 5G mobile communication; Channel estimation; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Generators; Data models; 5G NR; 3GPP; MIMO; VAE; WGAN-GP; Third-order moment",Generative and Explainable AI for High-Dimensional Channel Estimation,
"AI-Generated Content (AIGC) based on Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) is revolutionizing content creation and promoting substantial advancements in domains like autonomous driving and robotics. Leveraging progress in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and model compression techniques, GDMs are increasingly being deployed on Edge Servers (ESs) and User Equipments (UEs), which typically face resource limitations. In such MEC-enabled scenarios, designing an efficient inference scheme for GDMs still remains a significant challenge, due to the resource constraints on ESs and UEs as well as the personalized demands of AIGC users. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid inference scheme, which consists of two stages: public prompt generation and common-to-personalized inference. In the first stage, a Large Language Model (LLM) is adopted to generate public prompts derived from the common features of users' personal prompts. In the second stage, a common inference phase based on public prompts is first executed for all users (to produce common intermediate results), and then a personalized inference phase based on each user's personal prompts is performed for each individual user (to generate final contents). Clearly, by introducing the common inference phase, the total inference steps can be significantly reduced. In such a scheme, we further study a hybrid inference optimization problem to optimize both common and personalized inference steps, aiming to maximize the total Quality of Service (QoS), while minimizing delay and energy consumption. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, with the performance gains ranging from 12.6 % to 102.2 %.","Zhuang, Xinyi; Wu, Jiaqi; Wu, Hongjia; Tang, Ming; Gao, Lin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICC52391.2025.11161497,xvg3jbvnvn,,,,"ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on Communications, Communications, ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on",,1156,1151,,True,20250608,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Engineering Profession; Energy consumption; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Simulation; Quality of service; Performance gain; Diffusion models; Hybrid power systems; Distance measurement; Delays; Optimization",QoS-Driven Hybrid Inference Scheme for Generative Diffusion Models in MEC-Enabled AI-Generated Content Networks,
"In mmWave wireless networks, signal blockages present a significant challenge due to the susceptibility to environmental moving obstructions. Recently, the availability of visual data has been leveraged to enhance blockage prediction accuracy in mmWave networks. In this work, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approach for visual-aided blockage prediction that intelligently switches between mmWave and Sub-6 GHz frequencies to maximize network throughput and maintain reliable connectivity. Given the computational demands of processing visual data, we implement our solution within a hierarchical fog-cloud computing architecture, where fog nodes collaborate with cloud servers to efficiently manage computational tasks. This structure incorporates a generative AI-based compression technique that significantly reduces the volume of visual data transmitted between fog nodes and cloud centers.

"We leverage the latest advancements in generative AI for music creation to develop an automated system producing short sound messages. These sound-based messages, referred to as Transmit In Sound code (TIScode), are brief audio sequences lasting 5 seconds that carrying digital information. They can be recognized by a specific smartphone application in an Internet of Audio Things (IoAuT) scenario. We describe the methodologies of the TIScode pipeline, which includes generation, transmission, and ultimately, reception and decoding. For the generation phase, we use MusicGen, a state-of-the-art autoregressive transformer model, and we introduce a channel coding system based on the quantization of sound features and high-level features extracted through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The extracted features are mapped to create a unique bitmap for each TIScode, simplifying the decoding process. We present an algorithm for the recognition phase, combining sound feature analysis with frequency-based peak analysis to enhance detection accuracy. Experimental results, obtained through simulation and field tests, demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in retrieving the digital information encoded within sound messages.","Favero, Manuele; Buratto, Alessandro; Badia, Leonardo; Canazza, Sergio; Murrone, Luciano",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICMLCN64995.2025.11140271,g4vqhmkv4b,,,,"2025 IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning for Communication and Networking (ICMLCN), Machine Learning for Communication and Networking (ICMLCN), 2025 IEEE International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250526,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Photonics and Electrooptics; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Quantization (signal); <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Pipelines; Signal processing algorithms; Phase frequency detectors; Feature extraction; Transformers; Decoding; Channel coding; Digital information; Internet of Audio Things; Audio Classification; Channel Coding; Digital Signal Processing",Generative AI for Short Sound Message Transmission in the Internet of Things,

"Background: The integration of Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into healthcare is rapidly evolving, necessitating ethical preparedness among nursing students. GAI technologies present ethical challenges related to patient privacy, algorithmic bias, and informed consent, underscoring the need for structured AI ethics education in nursing curricula. This study aims to examine the impact of an ethics education program on nursing students' AI ethical awareness, moral sensitivity, attitudes, and intentions to use GAI in healthcare. Methods: A quasi experimental, pretest‒posttest study was conducted with 115 nursing students. The participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 57), which received a structured AI ethics education program, or a control group (n = 58), which did not receive the intervention. The validated scales measured AI ethical awareness, moral sensitivity, attitudes, and the intention to use AI before and after the intervention. Results: Compared with the control group, the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in AI ethical awareness (M = 57.28, SD = 22.28) (M = 47.43, SD = 24.04; p =.025, η² = 0.044). Moral sensitivity also showed a notable improvement in the intervention group (M = 74.33, SD = 29.93) compared with the control group (M = 60.26, SD = 22.52; p =.005, η² = 0.067). Compared with the control group, positive attitudes toward AI significantly increased postintervention (M = 39.46, SD = 11.51) (M = 23.21, SD = 11.72; p &lt;.001, η² = 0.332), indicating a strong effect of ethics education. Furthermore, the intention to use AI technology improved significantly in the intervention group (M = 12.46, SD = 3.55) compared with the control group (M = 10.24, SD = 3.15; p =.001, η² = 0.099). However, negative attitudes toward GAI did not significantly change postintervention. Conclusion: This study highlights the effectiveness of structured AI ethics education in enhancing ethical competencies among nursing students. Integrating such programs into nursing curricula is essential to prepare future nurses for ethical decision-making in AI-driven healthcare. These findings support the development of standardized ethics training modules to guide responsible AI use in clinical practice and inform future curriculum design.

"Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.","Rofena, Aurora; Manchia, Arianna; Piccolo, Claudia Lucia; Zobel, Bruno Beomonte; Soda, Paolo; Guarrasi, Valerio",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CBMS65348.2025.00039,5cipsxvon5,,,,"2025 IEEE 38th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS), Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS), 2025 IEEE 38th International Symposium on, CBMS",,146,141,,True,20250618,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Image segmentation; Visualization; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Pipelines; Breast cancer; Lesions; Standards; Image reconstruction; GANs; Cycle GAN; CESM; Breast Cancer; FFDM,Lesion-Aware Generative Artificial Intelligence for Virtual Contrast-Enhanced Mammography in Breast Cancer,
"In the rapidly evolving domain of cloud computing and cybersecurity, staying ahead of threats requires proactive and adaptive solutions. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework designed to enhance cloud security through automated attack generation, execution, and defense enhancement. The framework consists of four main components: the Database, the Generator, the Executor, and the Defender. The database comprises extensive data sources, including attack logs and security reports. The Generator utilizes the environment and system specifications to generate both traditional and zero-day attack vectors. The Executor classifies attacks, assigns them to specialized workers for execution, and consolidates the results into a comprehensive report. The Defender then analyzes this report to iteratively enhance the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This iterative process enhances the system’s resilience and robustness to future, unknown threats. The framework is adaptable, allowing customization to meet the security needs of various organizations making it well-suited for applications such as enterprise cloud security, cybersecurity education, and beyond. Future work will focus on building a simplified version of the system, which will later be expanded into a scalable architecture capable of addressing more intricate attack scenarios.","Helal, Mohamed Medhat; Abu-Elkheir, Mervat; Mashaly, Maggie",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/AIIT63112.2025.11082823,hamfcggimz,,,,"2025 International Conference on Innovation in <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Internet of Things (AIIT), Innovation in <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Internet of Things (AIIT), 2025 International Conference on",,8,1,,True,20250507,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Databases; Cloud computing security; Architecture; Buildings; Computer architecture; Generators; Vectors; Threat assessment; Cloud Security; Cloud Computing; Cyber Security; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Threat <mark>Intelligence</mark>",A Generative AI Framework for Cloud Security: Automated Attack Simulation and Threat Detection,
"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the world [1]. Mortality rates stand at 27 percent in India and 60 in Africa, compared to 7 in the US [2]. This disconnect boils down to the time of diagnosis. According to the CDC late-stage diagnosis has a five-year mortality rate of 69 percent, compared to 2 percent for early diagnosis [3]. Underserved communities lack access to high-cost, advanced diagnostic tech-nologies (MRIs/Mammograms) and cancer specialists (Oncolo-gists/Radiologists) [4]. Patients must depend on low-cost, low-resolution modalities (Ultrasounds) and the limited breast cancer expertise of general physicians (and gynecologists in developing countries), significantly delaying diagnosis and subsequent in-tervention [5]. This study aims to reduce global breast cancer mortality and healthcare costs by enabling accurate, early, and low-cost diagnosis using the existing ultrasound infrastructure in developing countries and underserved communities. To address data scarcity and skew, advanced image augmentation techniques such as deep convolutional GANs and stable diffusion models were evaluated. In each case of data augmentation, two classification approaches were compared: a lightweight MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network and a hybrid model combining ResNet50 for feature extraction with statistical machine learning models. The highest detection accuracy (95 percent) was achieved using the hybrid model with ResNet50 and XGBoost, paired with Stable Diffusion augmentation. An iOS app was implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in resource-constrained settings, showcasing its potential for scalable, efficient diagnostic solutions.","Gupta, Disha",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CAI64502.2025.00089,2sm2nkubr5,,,,"2025 IEEE Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (CAI), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (CAI), 2025 IEEE Conference on, CAI",,494,488,,True,20250505,IEEE,Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Ultrasonic imaging; Accuracy; Mortality; Developing countries; Breast cancer; Data models; Mobile applications; Medical diagnostic imaging; Residual neural networks; breast cancer screening; breast cancer diagnosis; breast ultrasound; <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; deep learning models; image augmentation; diffusion image augmentation; traditional image augmentation; underserved communities; ultrasound images; stable diffusion; hybrid architecture; early cancer diagnosis; early diagnosis; low-cost diagnosis; <mark>generative</mark> adversarial network; gan; mobilenetv2; resnet50; reducing mortality,"Reducing Global Breast Cancer Mortality with Early, Low-Cost Diagnosis Using Generative AI and Hybrid DL Architecture",
"In this evolving landscape of text generation, distinguishing between human-written and ChatGPT-generated content has become increasingly important. This paper presents a novel approach to authorship attribution, leveraging both Statistical Natural Language Processing (SNLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques to differentiate between documents written by humans and ChatGPTs. The research uses 212 abstracts of academic papers written and published by the research group as the human-written set and asks both ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 to generate corresponding abstracts based on paper titles as AI-written set. Models are trained on a laptop to classify human and AI-written abstract texts in 2-class (i.e., human and ChatGPT) and 3-class (i.e., human, ChatGPT 3.5, and ChatGPT 4) based on their part-of-speech tag frequency distribution patterns.

"This study aims to understand how faculty members at higher education institutions in Pakistan respond to the opportunities and challenges associated with using GAI in teaching and learning. The research employed a phenomenological approach within the qualitative research tradition. Data were collected from 33 university faculty members through semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed thematically. Our analysis identified that ethical issues and overreliance were significant challenges to the use of GAI. Key ethical challenges included data privacy and security and the unethical use of GAI in exams and assessments. Shortcomings in GAI's ability to produce unreliable outputs in instances could lead to potential bias due to over reliance on it. Overreliance may also compromise human values and privacy, replace human critical thinking capabilities, and encourage cheating and plagiarism. The key opportunities associated with the use of GAI included improved learning outcomes and contextual integration of GAI. Using GAI was found to improve knowledge acquisition and research efficiency, offering access to a vast amount of information, entertaining personalized learning needs, and generating course content. Tailored use in specific subjects or learning scenarios was also found to be an opportunity associated with the use of GAI. It was also found beneficial for use in data-intensive processes such as analyzing a long text or summarizing a report. Although there are some shortcomings that need to be addressed, the findings confirm that GAI is a valuable tool for education. It has the potential to transform into an invaluable asset for faculty and students alike, enriching their learning experiences. The introduction of GAI has opened up new opportunities for transforming teaching, learning, and research. However, certain emerging challenges must be addressed.

"The reliance on deep learning models for sensor-based material classification amplifies the demand for labeled training data. However, acquiring large-scale, annotated spectral data for applications such as near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy in plastic sorting remains a significant challenge due to high acquisition costs and environmental variability. This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) in synthetic spectral data generation. Specifically, it examines whether LLMs have acquired sufficient implicit knowledge to assist in generating spectral data and introduce meaningful variations that enhance model performance when used for data augmentation. Classification accuracy is reported exclusively as a proxy for structural plausibility of the augmented spectra; maximizing augmentation performance itself is not the study's goal. From as little as one empirical mean spectrum per class, LLM-guided simulation produced data that enabled up to 86% accuracy, evidence that the generated variation preserves class-distinguishing information. While the approach performs best for spectral distinct polymers, overlapping classes remain challenging. Additionally, the transfer of optimized augmentation parameters to unseen classes indicates potential for generalization across material types. While plastic sorting serves as a case study, the methodology may be applicable to other domains such as agriculture or food quality assessment, where spectral data are limited. The study outlines a novel path toward scalable, AI-supported data augmentation in spectroscopy-based classification systems.","Kulko, Roman-David; Hanus, Andreas; Elser, Benedikt",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/s25134114,g3a4ag2qbb,,,13,Sensors (14248220),,,4114,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=g3a4ag2qbb&recordId=g3a4ag2qbb&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Data augmentation; Materials analysis; Near infrared spectroscopy; Recycling management; Deep learning; Materials science; Spectrum analysis; Other Waste Collection; Materials Recovery Facilities,Generative Artificial Intelligence for Synthetic Spectral Data Augmentation in Sensor-Based Plastic Recycling.,25
"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as large language models (LLMs), generate natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks. This represents a significant technological advancement that poses opportunities and challenges to educational research and practice. This commentary brings together contributions from nine experts working in the intersection of learning and technology and presents critical reflections on the opportunities, challenges, and implications related to GenAI technologies in the context of education. In the commentary, it is acknowledged that GenAI's capabilities can enhance some teaching and learning practices, such as learning design, regulation of learning, automated content, feedback, and assessment. Nevertheless, we also highlight its limitations, potential disruptions, ethical consequences, and potential misuses. The identified avenues for further research include the development of new insights into the roles human experts can play, strong and continuous evidence, human-centric design of technology, necessary policy, and support and competence mechanisms. Overall, we concur with the general skeptical optimism about the use of GenAI tools such as LLMs in education. Moreover, we highlight the danger of hastily adopting GenAI tools in education without deep consideration of the efficacy, ecosystem-level implications, ethics, and pedagogical soundness of such practices.","Giannakos, Michail; Azevedo, Roger; Brusilovsky, Peter; Cukurova, Mutlu; Dimitriadis, Yannis; Hernandez-Leo, Davinia; Järvelä, Sanna; Mavrikis, Manolis; Rienties, Bart",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1080/0144929X.2024.2394886,pqlgft4tav,,,11,Behaviour &amp; Information Technology,,2544,2518,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=pqlgft4tav&recordId=pqlgft4tav&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,"<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Data security; Professional ethics; Computer software; Learning; Educational tests &amp; measurements; Natural language processing; Autodidacticism; Curriculum planning; Computer assisted instruction; Teacher-student relationships; Machine learning; Professional competence; Computer, computer peripheral and pre-packaged software merchant wholesalers; Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers; Computer and software stores; Software publishers (except video game publishers); Computer systems design and related services (except video game design and development); Other Computer Related Services",The promise and challenges of generative AI in education.,44
"As a passive behavior, intermittent discontinuance may lead to user defection and undermine the continuous development of generative artificial intelligence. From a cognition-affect-conation perspective, this research examined the enablers and inhibitors of generative AI user intermittent discontinuance. We adopted a mixed method of structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The results indicated that privacy concern and information hallucination influence cognitive dissonance, which further leads to intermittent discontinuance. In contrast, perceived intelligence, anthropomorphism, and personalization influence affective commitment, which prevents intermittent discontinuance. The results imply that generative AI companies need to be concerned with both cognitive dissonance and affective commitment in order to prevent user intermittent discontinuance.","Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Chunlei",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/10447318.2024.2376370,bbvirdx5wf,,,10,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,,6387,6377,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=bbvirdx5wf&recordId=bbvirdx5wf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250515,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Cognitive dissonance; Passivity (Psychology); Structural equation modeling; Anthropomorphism,Examining Generative AI User Intermittent Discontinuance from a C-A-C Perspective.,41

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is emerging as a disruptive force, both economically and socially, with its use spanning from the provision of goods and services to everyday activities such as healthcare and household management. This study analyzes the enabling and inhibiting factors of GAI use in Spain based on a large-scale survey conducted by the Spanish Center for Sociological Research on the use and perception of artificial intelligence. The proposed model is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and is fitted using machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, Random Forest extensions, and extreme gradient boosting. While decision trees allow for detailed visualization of how variables interact to explain usage, Random Forest provides an excellent model fit (R2 close to 95%) and predictive performance. The use of Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that knowledge about artificial intelligence, followed by innovation orientation, is the main explanatory variable of GAI use. Among sociodemographic variables, Generation X and Z stood out as the most relevant. It is also noteworthy that the perceived privacy risk does not show a clear inhibitory influence on usage. Factors representing the positive consequences of GAI, such as performance expectancy and social utility, exert a stronger influence than the negative impact of hindering factors such as perceived privacy or social risks.","Pérez-Portabella, Antonio; Andrés-Sánchez, Jorge de; Arias-Oliva, Mario; Souto-Romero, Mar",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/a18070410,i6lyizbfzj,,,7,Algorithms,,,410,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=i6lyizbfzj&recordId=i6lyizbfzj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Planned behavior theory; Innovation adoption; Machine learning; Prediction models; Sociological research; Spain; Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities,Integrating Machine Learning Techniques and the Theory of Planned Behavior to Assess the Drivers of and Barriers to the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence: Evidence in Spain.,18

"ChatGPT, which rides on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has garnered exponential attention worldwide since its release in 2022. While there is an increasing number of studies probing into the potential benefits and challenges of ChatGPT in education, most of them confine the focus to informal learning and higher education. The formal adoption of ChatGPT in authentic classroom settings, especially in K-12 contexts, remains underexplored. In view of this gap, we conducted a quasi-experiment to study the effects of integrating ChatGPT into a compulsory Grade-10 English as a foreign language (EFL) writing course in a Hong Kong secondary school. The participants (99 Grade-10 students) were divided into treatment or control groups; the former and latter respectively used ChatGPT and conventional media as the tool for EFL writing instruction. The analysis of the participants' EFL writing performance at the end of the experiment shows that the treatment group outperformed the control group. Further, there was a significant interaction effect between the assigned group of participants and their baseline level of EFL proficiency. Compared to the high-achieving participants, low-achieving ones tended to benefit more from ChatGPT-supported EFL writing instruction in the experiment. These findings together suggest that ChatGPT has the potential to be applied in formal EFL writing instruction in K-12 classroom settings.","Leisi Pei; Siu-Yung Jong, Morris; Biyun Huang; Wai-Chung Pang; Junjie Shang",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.30191/ETS.202507_28(3).TP05,fymtzsaebn,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,297,281,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=fymtzsaebn&recordId=fymtzsaebn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,International Forum of Educational Technology &amp; Society (IFETS),<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Foreign language education; ChatGPT; English as a foreign language; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language Schools,Formally integrating Generative AI into secondary education: Application of ChatGPT in EFL writing instruction.,28

"As the most revolutionary technological innovation in the field of artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence has profoundly reshaped the paradigm of information dissemination and the mode of social cognition through its strong self-learning ability and the ability to personalize texts, images, videos and other contents. according to the needs of users. However, the technical characteristics of generative artificial intelligence also hide multiple security risks. Powerful countries take advantage of this to put on the cloak of technology and turn to ""digital hegemony"" and ""digital colonialism"", which makes ideological penetration more concealed; the ""decentralized"" communication mode has diversified the main body of information dissemination, which has weakened the influence of the state's interpretation right; the ""customized"" form of digital communication creates the illusion of artificial empathy, which weakens individual independent thinking and critical ideas. In order to better study the causes of the ideological risks ofgenerative artificial intelligence, the process of its content output is disassembled in this paper, and it is found that the corpus of generative artificial intelligence is selective. the algorithm is intervenient, and the end user's cognition is controllable. This shows that the whole process of the operation of generative artificial intelligence contains more human factors, which provides a legal basis for its legal regulation. The governance capability of generative artificial intelligence generation represents a country's scientific and technological innovation capability and value leadership capability to a certain extent. At present. China's regulatory system and governance framework for generative artificial intelligence have been preliminarily formed. This paper takes five important special legislation such as the Interim Measures for the Administration of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services as the research object. takes ideological security protection as the governance goal, and compares it with the operation logic of generative artificial intelligence. It finds that there are certain deficiencies in the legal norms of Chinese artificial intelligence, such as omissions in the objects of legal regulation and accountability, operational challenges exist in the legal implementation of algorithmic classification and grading systems, and incomplete information disclosure and complaint reporting mechanisms. To this end, we should further clarify the responsibility of each subject in the whole process for content security, establish and improve the algorithmic classification and grading systems. improve the terminal feedback and disposal mechanism. maintain the ideological security in the field of generative artificial intelligence, and ensure the healthy development of the artificial intelligence industry. Compared with the previous literature, this paper has made expansion in the following two aspects: firstly, it analyses the operating mechanism of generative artificial intelligence, clarified the human factors therein, and provided a basis for the transformation from a technical perspective to a standardized governance: secondly, it systematically sorts out current legal documents for generative artificial intelligence and proposes tripartite governance pathways (upstream, midstream, downstream) to enhance both technical and regulatory oversight centering on ideological security protection. Generative artificial intelligence has become a strategic domain in great-power competition, impacting not only industrial and economic leadership but also the rule-making authority in the digital era.

"Background: Adopting generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education rapidly transforms learning environments, yet nursing students' acceptance and anxiety toward these technologies remain underexplored in Middle Eastern contexts. This study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by incorporating constructs such as Facilitating Conditions (FC) and Social Influence (SI). It investigates the moderating role of Anxiety on Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU) generative AI tools. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,055 undergraduate nursing students across four Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire comprising the Generative Artificial Intelligence Acceptance Scale and the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale. Structural equation modeling was employed to evaluate relationships among Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), FC, SI, and BIU, with Anxiety as a moderator. Descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, and path analysis were performed using SPSS and Python's semopy library. Results: The model demonstrated strong explanatory power, with 75.09% of the variance in BIU explained by the TAM constructs and Anxiety. Path coefficients revealed significant positive relationships between PE (β = 0.477, p &lt; 0.001), EE (β = 0.293, p &lt; 0.001), FC (β = 0.189, p &lt; 0.001), and SI (β = 0.308, p &lt; 0.001) and BIU. Anxiety had the strongest moderating effect (β = 0.552, p &lt; 0.001), indicating its critical role in shaping behavioral intentions. Gender, year of study, and access to technology emerged as significant demographic variables influencing acceptance and anxiety levels.

"Previous studies have demonstrated that summarization activities effectively enhance students' reading comprehension and learning performance. With the ongoing surge in the application of artificial intelligence in education, this study introduces a chatbot with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to assist students in reviewing Python programming concepts by refining the summary after class. Consequently, this study aims to assess the efficacy of the proposed a GenAI-enabled chatbot in enhancing the summarization ability and learning performance of novice programmers in college. Experimental results reveal that, the GenAIenabled chatbot not only significantly improves students' programming coding performance but also significantly improves their summarization ability. It is noteworthy that students' summarization proficiency is not only elevated from the outset but also consistently progresses until the end. This study also identified that understanding the Python programming concepts of input/output operations and lists serves as predictors for learning performance in programming concept and coding, respectively. This emphasizes the significance of fundamental programming concept and a nuanced understanding of advanced data types in programming learning.","Huang, Anna Y.

"This paper describes an attempt to automate threat hunting, taking cyber threat intelligence messages as input and generating queries to search logs for attack evidence using a popular query language, Kibana, used in Security Operations Centers (SOC). Our prototype implementation, AIThreatTrack, uses GPT-4 to extract actionable threat intelligence from real-time messages like X and Slack. The core idea is to explain the extracted intelligence in terms of MITRE ATT&amp;CK TTPs using a knowledge graph containing ""is-a"" and ""part-of"" relationships (extracted using GPT-4) with the following benefits:(a) Significantly reduced hallucinations from 47% (GPT-4) to 1.5% using two orthogonal ways to cross-check answers. (b) Gaining analysts’ trust with explained results. (c) Using chain-of-knowledge prompting to significantly improve query generation accuracy. This approach supports expanding the scope of the knowledge graph to further improve query generation. Our approach significantly outperforms the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and chain-of-thought reasoning LLM in reducing hallucinations.","Purba, Moumita Das; Chu, Bill; French, Will",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/DSN64029.2025.00067,6xcmqjmeqn,,,,"2025 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), 2025 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on, DSN",,677,664,,True,20250623,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Retrieval augmented generation; Prototypes; Knowledge graphs; Real-time systems; Cognition; Cyber threat <mark>intelligence</mark>; Security; Database languages; Threat hunting; Large Language Model; GPT-4; OpenAI o1; Knowledge Graph; Kibana; Prompt; RAG",Towards Automated and Explainable Threat Hunting with Generative AI,
"The rapid growth of e-commerce in Indonesia, with Tokopedia as a leading platform, generated an abundance of online reviews containing both text and images, which offered valuable insights into customer experiences. These reviews provided essential feedback that helped businesses understand consumer sentiment, preferences, and expectations. Traditional sentiment analysis models like BERT, RoBERTa, and FNet, performed well with text data but struggled with visual information. This research introduced a hybrid approach that combined Transfer Learning for text analysis with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image analysis to enhance overall multimodal sentiment analysis accuracy. When visual content was unavailable, Stable Diffusion v2-base can generated synthetic images from text, which significantly improved the availability of visual data. Following the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) framework, which included selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and evaluation, this study found that BERT achieved the highest text-based accuracy at 90.97 % and RoBERTa at 90.33 %. In the image-based approach, CNN reached an accuracy of 54.25 %, while the hybrid CNN-BERT model led with $\mathbf{9 0. 6 0 \%}$, followed by CNN-RoBERTa at $\mathbf{8 9. 4 0 \%}$. These findings highlighted the potential of multimodal sentiment analysis in providing effective marketing strategies, informing product development, and enhanced customer satisfaction, ultimately offering a significant competitive advantage in the e-commerce sector.","Karaeng, Cristin Natalia; Kristiyanti, Dinar Ajeng",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICERA66156.2025.11087376,uvgz6nucrr,,,,"2025 4th International Conference on Electronics Representation and Algorithm (ICERA), Electronics Representation and Algorithm (ICERA), 2025 4th International Conference on",,6,01,,True,20250612,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Sentiment analysis; Visualization; Accuracy; Text analysis; Reviews; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Transfer learning; Product development; Convolutional neural networks; Electronic commerce; Convolutional Neural Network-BERT; E-Commerce Product Review; Multimodal Sentiment Analysis; Transfer Learning",Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Approach Combining Transfer Learning and Generative AI of E-Commerce Product Reviews,
"Recently, several applications and specialized versions of ChatGPT have been developed to either create personalized exercise programs based on the fitness levels of practitioners or to provide post-exercise nutrition and recovery advice. However, existing specialized ChatGPTs are limited to specific tasks, and not well-finetuned. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of ChatGPT as a personalized assistant capable of correcting improper postures and analyzing body compositions. We trained ChatGPT to improve posture during exercises and daily activities, thereby enhancing its role as an assistant to prevent injuries and optimize training effectiveness. In addition, we explore ChatGPT's potential to understand body compositions and predict physical transformations, providing users with insights into the outcomes of their fitness and nutrition efforts. Our results indicate that the current ChatGPT model can identify and correct incorrect postures, but struggles to provide visual aids for the correction. It can also provide training schedules and nutrition plans based on requirements, but those plans tend to be general and lack customization. In terms of body composition, ChatGPT can analyze body fat on a broader scale, but with less sensitivity to smaller changes in body fat. The performance of ChatGPT can be further improved using more image datasets related to gym exercises, human postures, and body compositions.","Li, Jiaye; Abouzahir, Saad; El Saddik, Abdulmotaleb",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MeMeA65319.2025.11068068,xq2tmh7a5f,,,,"2025 IEEE Medical Measurements &amp; Applications (MeMeA), Medical Measurements &amp; Applications (MeMeA), 2025 IEEE",,5,1,,True,20250528,IEEE,Bioengineering; Engineering Profession; Training; Visualization; Schedules; Accuracy; Sensitivity; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Chatbots; Fats; Reliability; Large Language Model; Fitness Coaching; Posture Analysis; Well-being,Integrating Generative AI for Enhanced Fitness Coaching: From Exercise form to Posture and Body Composition Analysis,

"To create, evaluate, and compare different technologies of home health monitoring, people need lots of sensor data that captures (1) residents' activities of daily living (ADL) like bathing, and (2) their usage of home appliances like watching TV. Unfortunately, such datasets of real-world monitoring are quite limited and scarce, due to issues like sensor cost, technique complexity, and deployment time. Existing simulators attempt to resolve these issues, by generating synthetic data based on predefined models or interactions with users. However, they give little consideration to personas, and rarely support personalized simulation based on humans' age, lifestyles, or health conditions. This paper introduces our novel investigation of using ChatGPT to create usable and shareable datasets of (1) human daily activities, and (2) their usage of home appliances. Specifically, there are two phases in our investigation. First, we described personas of home residents and layouts of home appliances, in order to use ChatGPT to generate data that mimic human behaviors and schedule their usage of appliances. Second, we analyzed and visualized the generated data to check whether the data is meaningful. Our results show great promise: the daily activities of different humans match the described personas, and the simulated appliance usage resembles the typical appliance usage in real-world settings. Our work may shed light on future directions of ADL simulation. It also facilitates studies on home health monitoring, disease diagnosis, and home automation.","Sarvaiya, Harditya; Hasegawa, Masaki; Zeng, Haibo; Gao, Xinghua; Meng, Na",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICPS65515.2025.11087850,fkkvkeivmv,,,,"2025 IEEE 8th International Conference on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), 2025 IEEE 8th International Conference on",,7,1,,True,20250512,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Home appliances; Schedules; TV; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Layout; Smart homes; Chatbots; Medical diagnosis; Monitoring; Synthetic data; ChatGPT; simulation; activities of daily living (ADL); persona; lifestyles; personalization",Simulating Personalized Smart-Home Activity Datasets with Generative AI: A Case Study,
"This paper presents the methodology for using LLMs to ease core network signaling analysis. This is done by applying RAG techniques to process standards that describe protocol data formats - and then asking natural language questions about actual capture traces. Analyzing 5G networks is very challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of signaling protocols. Unlike previous generations, protocol fields and values are described in a human-readable format, enabling textual post-processing, and the direct application of LLM models. Intent-based network management involves natural language-based human interaction with the networking equipment so the desired outcome is achieved without step-by-step instructions and settings by the human. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses the combination of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Langchain to automatically answer human questions regarding signalling data. This toolchain makes the analysis part of network fault management intent-based. Moreover, by training LLMs on a vast corpus of standardized signaling data, we demonstrate the model's ability to generate realistic test data. This approach improves the efficiency of automated test environments, ensuring the reliability and performance of networks in real-world conditions.","Tothfalusi, Tamas; Csiszar, Zoltan; Varga, Pal",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/NOMS57970.2025.11073654,icjpsrbhgn,,,,"NOMS 2025-2025 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium, Network Operations and Management Symposium, NOMS 2025-2025 IEEE",,7,1,,True,20250512,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; Training; Protocols; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Retrieval augmented generation; Natural languages; Network analyzers; Data models; Communications technology; Telecommunication network reliability; Standards",TACO - A Generative AI Copilot for Intent-Based Telecommunication Core Network Analysis,
"This study investigated the effectiveness of different GenAI-driven feedback prompts in improving college students’ learning of classical Chinese poetry. A four-week quasi-experimental intervention was conducted with 79 college students, divided into two groups: the experimental group received progressive text GenAI feedback, while the control group received one-time text feedback. The study examined the impact of these feedback methods on students’ cognitive load, learning motivation, understanding, aesthetic emotional experience, and critical thinking. The intervention focused on four classical Chinese poems with a think-feel-aloud (TFA) protocol. The results showed that the progressive feedback method significantly enhanced students’ learning motivation, comprehension, and aesthetic emotional engagement with the poetry. However, there was no significant difference in cognitive load and critical thinking between the two groups, suggesting that while the GenAI feedback improved certain aspects of poetry learning, it did not foster critical thinking to a measurable extent within the intervention duration of this study.","Wang, Yi; Luo, Zichen; Guo, Dongpo; Zhou, Zhijin; Paas, Fred",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11092104,oda2frpjm5,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,537,533,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computer science; Protocols; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Cognitive load; Chinese poetry learning; Text-GenAI; Progressive feedback prompt",Impacts of a progressive feedback prompt-based text-generative AI approach on Chinese poetry learning,
"Modern communication systems face challenges in replicating jammer behaviors when interference parameters are unknown. This study explores the use of Stable Diffusion, fine-tuned with LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate high-level, text-based abstractions that characterize unknown interference patterns. By utilizing a single jammer and receiver, and providing spectrogram images of the received signals, the model is able to generate reasonable representations of the interference. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined signal models, our approach enables the synthesis of interference spectrograms without prior knowledge of jammer parameters or transmitted signals. By leveraging diffusion models, we provide a scalable and flexible framework for approximating and representing unknown interference, offering a novel direction for abstracted interference modeling in software-defined radio (SDR) systems.","Tylek, Matthew; Truongcao, Keith; Hossain, Md Shakir; Dandekar, Kapil R.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/WAMICON64429.2025.11004115,aitfcqkv7v,,,,"2025 IEEE Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference (WAMICON), Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference (WAMICON), 2025 IEEE",,4,1,,True,20250414,IEEE,"Aerospace; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Photonics and Electrooptics; Wireless communication; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Retrieval augmented generation; LoRa; Interference; Receivers; Real-time systems; Jamming; Spectrogram; Software radio; Software-defined radio; Stable diffusion; LoRA; Waveform synthesis; Interference modeling; IQ data",Generative AI for Wireless Interference Modeling: Text-Controlled Waveform Synthesis Using Stable Diffusion,

"Access to domain expertise is critical to problem-solving activities. This study investigates the role and usefulness of an AI-based troubleshooting assistant in the knowledge-intensive context of train commissioning. The authors developed a multilingual, user-centred chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework and a Large Language Model to provide real-time, project-specific troubleshooting support. A controlled field experiment with 19 commissioning technicians completing 173 tasks was conducted to evaluate the effect of the AI assistant. Results show that AI-assisted users significantly outperformed non-users in task performance. The benefits were more substantial among less experienced technicians, which emphasises the prospect of AI assistants in bridging skill gaps. Performance gains were also moderated by the AI attitudes and AI familiarity of technicians, suggesting that organisations should take these factors into account when striving to adopt AI assistants. The findings provide empirical evidence for the role of generative AI in scaling operational knowledge, enhancing worker performance, and improving the efficiency of engineering workflows.

"The project is about dataset marketplace platform to help the users to manage, share and generate datasets. It is built up on the SQLite and FAISS to achieve robust data management and fast similarity comparison. Userdata and metadata of datasets, such as the file paths and descriptions, are kept inside the SQLite database. This actually helps you to search and download millions of data information. FAISS, on the other hand, is primarily used for the indexing of high-dimensional vectors and similarity detection [2]. It lets the platform storage and query vector embeddings from datasets in a performant way, which helps to source features such as duplicate detection and relevancy-based recommendations. This is especially beneficial for finding a dataset, which is similar to a user's own data, or to prevent uploading of redundant data. It also has capabilities to create synthetic data by statistical and GAN methods. This functionality can help users to complement their datasets with artificial samples which might be beneficial for training machine learning models or preserving privacy, so that there is no dependency on original data. In summary, the project is building a whole environment for dataset management, which includes uploading, searching, downloading, and creating datasets while keeping their integrity as well as user privacy.

"Fully-decoupled RAN (FD-RAN) has emerged as one of the most promising architectures for next-generation mobile communication networks to enable flexible resource utilization and cater to diverse user requirements, owing to its complete decoupling of control, uplink and downlink entities. AI-native solutions, including AI-assisted air interfaces and mobility management, hold significant promise for achieving these objectives. However, the efficacy of such solutions hinges on accurate wireless channel knowledge. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of a Digital Twin Channel (DTC), which leverages ray tracing to generate channels based on digitalized environments. To mitigate the complexity of constructing precise DTCs in practical scenarios, we propose the Generative Digital Twin Channel (GDTC). This approach employs generative AI (GAI) models for environment reconstruction and radio wave propagation modeling, effectively empowering FD-RAN. We further present a comprehensive GDTC pipeline designed to produce accurate channels from environment and support decision-making across various communication tasks. To illustrate the capabilities of GDTC, we demonstrate through a case study to realize the feedback-free transmission task, which represents a promising paradigm envisioned for 6G. We utilize the vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to recover a specific channel accurately, as well as generate the representative channel optimized for feedback-free transmission.","Liu, Zongxi; Chen, Jiacheng; Xu, Yunting; Du, Hongyang; Zhou, Haibo",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MCOM.001.2400753,wozird3fq5,,,10,"IEEE Communications Magazine, Communications Magazine, IEEE, IEEE Commun.

Drawing attention to AI systems’ opportunities, the study examines the subsequent issues connected with AI applications, including over-dependence on AI tools, adversarial risk to models, and the complex nature of decisionmaking in the context of AI systems. The present study also highlights the importance of generative AI in strengthening the defense of the cloud environment, but, at the same time, it recognizes the significance of preventive efforts and planned action plans to manage these technologies efficiently.","Patel, Advait; Pandey, Pravin; Ragothaman, Hariharan; Molleti, Ramasankar; Peddinti, Diwakar Reddy",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICAIC63015.2025.10849302,z2rf2edvir,,,,"2025 IEEE 4th International Conference on <mark>AI</mark> in Cybersecurity (ICAIC), <mark>AI</mark> in Cybersecurity (ICAIC), 2025 IEEE 4th International Conference on",,7,1,,True,20250205,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Technological innovation; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Cloud computing security; Organizations; Real-time systems; Threat assessment; Time factors; Protection; Monitoring; cloud security; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; incident response; soar systems",Generative AI for Automated Security Operations in Cloud Computing,
"Wildfires increasingly threaten human life, ecosystems, and infrastructure, with events like the 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County underscoring the urgent need for more advanced prediction frameworks. Existing physics-based and deep-learning models struggle to capture dynamic wildfire spread across both 2D and 3D domains, especially when incorporating real-time, multimodal geospatial data. This paper explores how generative artificial intelligence (AI) models—such as GANs, VAEs, and transformers—can serve as transformative tools for wildfire prediction and simulation. These models offer superior capabilities in managing uncertainty, integrating multimodal inputs, and generating realistic, scalable wildfire scenarios. We adopt a new paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) for literature synthesis, classification, and knowledge extraction, conducting a systematic review of recent studies applying generative AI to fire prediction and monitoring. We highlight how generative approaches uniquely address challenges faced by traditional simulation and deep-learning methods. Finally, we outline five key future directions for generative AI in wildfire management, including unified multimodal modeling of 2D and 3D dynamics, agentic AI systems and chatbots for decision intelligence, and real-time scenario generation on mobile devices, along with a discussion of critical challenges. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift toward multimodal generative frameworks to support proactive, data-informed wildfire response.","Xu, Haowen; Zlatanova, Sisi; Liang, Ruiyu; Canbulat, Ismet",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/fire8080293,776kp3ke6z,,,8,Fire (2571-6255),,,293,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=776kp3ke6z&recordId=776kp3ke6z&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Deep learning; Decision making; Fire risk assessment; Dynamic models; Metadata; Computer simulation; Three-dimensional imaging,Generative AI as a Pillar for Predicting 2D and 3D Wildfire Spread: Beyond Physics-Based Models and Traditional Deep Learning.,8
"The increasing complexity and scale of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks pose significant security challenges, necessitating the development of advanced intrusion detection systems (IDS). Traditional IDS approaches, such as rule-based and signature-based methods, are often inadequate in detecting novel and sophisticated attacks due to their limited adaptability and dependency on predefined patterns. To overcome these limitations, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based IDS have been introduced, offering better generalization and the ability to learn from data. However, these models can still struggle with zero-day attacks, require large volumes of labeled data, and may be vulnerable to adversarial examples. In response to these challenges, Generative AI-based IDS—leveraging models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Transformers—have emerged as promising solutions that offer enhanced adaptability, synthetic data generation for training, and improved detection capabilities for evolving threats. This survey provides an overview of IoV architecture, vulnerabilities, and classical IDS techniques while focusing on the growing role of Generative AI in strengthening IoV security. It discusses the current landscape, highlights the key challenges, and outlines future research directions aimed at building more resilient and intelligent IDS for the IoV ecosystem.","Mahmoudi, Isra; Boubiche, Djallel Eddine; Athmani, Samir; Toral-Cruz, Homero; Chan-Puc, Freddy I.",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/fi17070310,iy2pbufbzv,,,7,Future Internet,,,310,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=iy2pbufbzv&recordId=iy2pbufbzv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Intrusion detection systems (Computer security); Computer security vulnerabilities; Machine learning; Intelligent transportation systems; Cyberterrorism; Deep learning; Metadata,Toward Generative AI-Based Intrusion Detection Systems for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV).,17
"For over half a century, computer-aided structural elucidation systems (CASE) for organic compounds have relied on complex expert systems with explicitly programmed algorithms. These systems are often computationally inefficient for complex compounds due to the vast chemical structural space that must be explored and filtered. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept transformer based generative chemical language artificial intelligence (AI) model, an innovative end-to-end architecture designed to replace the logic and workflow of the classic CASE framework for ultra-fast and accurate spectroscopic-based structural elucidation. Our model employs an encoder-decoder architecture and self-attention mechanisms, similar to those in large language models, to directly generate the most probable chemical structures that match the input spectroscopic data. Trained on ~ 102 k IR, UV, and 1H NMR spectra, it performs structural elucidation of molecules with up to 29 atoms in just a few seconds on a modern CPU, achieving a top-15 accuracy of 83%. This approach demonstrates the potential of transformer based generative AI to accelerate traditional scientific problem-solving processes. The model's ability to iterate quickly based on new data highlights its potential for rapid advancements in structural elucidation. Scientific Contribution: This study introduces a transformer-based generative AI model as a novel approach to structural elucidation for organic compounds, replacing traditional CASE systems with an end-to-end encoder-decoder architecture. This work demonstrates the potential of transformer models to revolutionize CASE by significantly accelerating the elucidation process and enabling rapid iterations with new data.","Tan, Xiaofeng",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1186/s13321-025-01016-1,yqzyj2t7u5,,,1,Journal of Cheminformatics,,14,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=yqzyj2t7u5&recordId=yqzyj2t7u5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250712,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models; Machine learning; Transformer models,A transformer based generative chemical language AI model for structural elucidation of organic compounds.,17
"Generative AI is increasingly used to create images from text, but its role in documentary photography remains under-explored. This paper investigates how generative AI can be integrated into documentary practice while maintaining ethical standards. Through interviews with six documentary photographers, we explored their views on AI's potential to support community-driven storytelling.While AI presents opportunities for creative expression and community involvement, concerns about trust, authenticity, and decontextualization of images persist. Photographers expressed doubts about AI's ability to accurately represent lived experiences, fearing it could compromise narrative integrity. Our findings suggest that AI tools should be designed to enhance collaboration and transparency in storytelling, complementing rather than replacing traditional documentary methods. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI in photography, advocating for the development of tools that preserve the ethical foundations of documentary storytelling while empowering communities.","Martinez, Lenny; Caramiaux, Baptiste; Fdili Alaoui, Sarah",OpenAIRE,,10.1145/3706598.3714200,hbxgsywkob,,,,Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,,13,1,,False,20250425,ACM,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Documentary photography; Text-to-image generation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> Documentary photography Visual storytelling Text-to-image generation; [INFO.INFO-HC] Computer Science [cs]/Human-Computer Interaction [cs.HC]; Visual storytelling,Generative AI in Documentary Photography: Exploring Opportunities and Challenges for Visual Storytelling,
"Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, a sense of identity and purpose, and social integration. Job insecurity, underemployment and unemployment are well-documented risk factors for mental health issues and suicide. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement and its corollary impacts on individual and social wellbeing. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy using Australian data as a case study. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6–31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6–28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital-to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for cross-sectoral government measures to ensure a smooth transition to an AI-dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.","Occhipinti, Jo-An; Hynes, William; Prodan, Ante; Eyre, Harris; Green, Roy; Burrow, Sharan; Tanner, Marcel; Buchanan, John; Ujdur, Goran; Destrebecq, Frederic; Song, Christine; Carnevale, Steven; Hickie, Ian B.; Heffernan, Mark",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1038/s41598-025-08498-x,7od7tar6uj,,,1,Scientific Reports,,11,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7od7tar6uj&recordId=7od7tar6uj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250718,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Job security; Economic equilibrium; Economic development; Mental health; Intervention (Federal government); Offices of Mental Health Practitioners (except Physicians),Generative AI may create a socioeconomic tipping point through labour displacement.,15
"With the wide application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology in society, GenAI literacy and critical thinking are considered vital competencies for success in the future. As future teachers, pre-service teachers (PSTs) must possess these key competencies. Previous research has pointed out that although learning and applying GenAI knowledge and technology can improve PSTs' GenAI literacy, the results were not as expected. This study incorporated a KWL (Know, Want, Learned)-based reflection strategy based on the SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer) model, and proposed an RSCQA (Reflection, Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer) approach, which aims to help PSTs develop GenAI literacy and critical thinking. A quasi-experiment was designed for this study to verify the validity of the RSCQA approach, which was used by the experimental group, while the Conventional SCQA (CSCQA) approach was used by the control group. Results of the study demonstrated that using the RSCQA approach improved PSTs' GenAI literacy and critical thinking, and they excelled in multimodal demonstration capability. This study also conducted an ENA analysis of the content of PSTs' reflections, and the results demonstrated that reflective strategies help PSTs engage in higher-order cognitive activities. The results of the qualitative interviews further indicated that the reflective strategy enhanced PSTs' learning effectiveness and strengthened their critical thinking.

"Generative artificial intelligence (gAI) tools and large language models (LLMs) are gaining popularity among non-specialist audiences (patients, caregivers, and the general public) as a source of plain language medical information. AI-based models have the potential to act as a convenient, customizable and easy-to-access source of information that can improve patients' self-care and health literacy and enable greater engagement with clinicians. However, serious negative outcomes could occur if these tools fail to provide reliable, relevant and understandable medical information. Herein, we review published findings on opportunities and risks associated with such use of gAI/LLMs. We reviewed 44 articles published between January 2023 and July 2024. From the included articles, we find a focus on readability and accuracy; however, only three studies involved actual patients. Responses were reported to be reasonably accurate and sufficiently readable and detailed. The most commonly reported risks were oversimplification, over-generalization, lower accuracy in response to complex questions, and lack of transparency regarding information sources. There are ethical concerns that overreliance/unsupervised reliance on gAI/LLMs could lead to the ""humanizing"" of these models and pose a risk to patient health equity, inclusiveness and data privacy. For these technologies to be truly transformative, they must become more transparent, have appropriate governance and monitoring, and incorporate feedback from healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients, and other experts. Uptake of these technologies will also need education and awareness among non-specialist audiences around their optimal use as sources of plain language medical information. Plain Language Summary: More and more people are using special computer programs called artificial intelligence (AI) or large language models (LLMs) to find and get medical facts in simple words they can understand. This can help people take better care of themselves, learn about their health, and talk with their doctors. We found that AI/LLMs generally provided correct and helpful information to people. However, there could also be a risk of incorrect or unreliable information in certain situations if the question is complex. This can cause harm to people if they use this information to make their own medical decisions. Also, gAI/LLMs provide human-like responses, which make people trust them more than they should. There could be a risk that people may share their medical information with AI/LLMs, which could get into the wrong hands. To make sure these programs really help people, they need to be clear about how they work, and they must have good rules to follow and take advice from doctors and patients to improve performance. People also need to be trained on how to best use these AI tools to find easy-to-understand and reliable medical information. It is important for doctors, patients and other health workers to help make sure the AI is producing reliable and understandable medical information for patients.","Pal, Avishek; Wangmo, Tenzin; Bharadia, Trishna; Ahmed-Richards, Mithi; Bhanderi, Mayank Bhailalbhai; Kachhadiya, Rohitbhai; Allemann, Samuel S; Elger, Bernice Simone",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.2147/PPA.S527922,5qlm7qbx6b,,,,Patient Preference &amp; Adherence,,2249,2227,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=5qlm7qbx6b&recordId=5qlm7qbx6b&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Dove Medical Press Ltd,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models; Ethics; Possibility; Health literacy; Patient participation; Hazards,"Generative AI/LLMs for Plain Language Medical Information for Patients, Caregivers and General Public: Opportunities, Risks and Ethics.",19
"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and edge intelligence (EI) are driving the evolution of traditional vehicular networks toward the intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IIoV) by providing foundational and personalized knowledge. However, their inherently contradictory characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay between GAI and EI.","Chen, N.; Cheng, Z.; Fan, X.; Liu, Z.; Yang, J.; Huang, B.; Zhao, Y.; Huang, L.; Du, X.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MVT.2025.3534410,7web7zxsf5,,,2,"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine, Vehicular Technology Magazine, IEEE, IEEE Veh.

"Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) bridges the cyberspace and the physical space, driving advancements in autonomous systems like the V ehicular E mbodied A I NET work (VEANET). VEANET integrates advanced AI capabilities into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied Agent Twins (EATs) are digital models of these embodied agents, with various Embodied Agent AI Twins (EAATs) for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANETs, EAATs act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited onboard computational resources, AVs offload EAATs to nearby RoadSide Units (RSUs). However, the mobility of AVs and limited RSU coverage necessitates dynamic migrations of EAATs, posing challenges in selecting suitable RSUs under information asymmetry. To address this, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs, thus enhancing the efficiency of EAAT migrations. Numerical results demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed GDM-based scheme in facilitating EAAT migrations compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning methods.","Zhong, Y.; Kang, J.; Wen, J.; Ye, D.; Nie, J.; Niyato, D.; Gao, X.; Xie, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TMC.2025.3526230,ak7fjfxspj,,,5,"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans. on Mobile Comput.",,4588,4573,,True,20250501,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Signal Processing and Analysis; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Contracts; Real-time systems; Decision making; Vehicle dynamics; Solid modeling; Computational modeling; Adaptation models; Navigation; Diffusion models; Vehicular embodied <mark>AI</mark>; multi-dimensional contract theory; <mark>generative</mark> diffusion model; prospect theory",Generative Diffusion-Based Contract Design for Efficient AI Twin Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks,24

"Artificial intelligence (AI) as a disruptive technology is not new. However, its recent evolution, engineered by technological transformation, big data analytics, and quantum computing, produces conversational and generative AI (CGAI/GenAI) and human‐like chatbots that disrupt conventional operations and methods in different fields. This study investigates the scientific landscape of CGAI and human–chatbot interaction/collaboration and evaluates use cases, benefits, challenges, and policy implications for multidisciplinary education and allied industry operations. The publications trend showed that just 4% (n = 75) occurred during 2006–2018, while 2019–2023 experienced astronomical growth (n = 1763 or 96%). The prominent use cases of CGAI (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching, learning, and research activities occurred in computer science (multidisciplinary and AI; 32%), medical/healthcare (17%), engineering (7%), and business fields (6%). The intellectual structure shows strong collaboration among eminent multidisciplinary sources in business, information systems, and other areas. The thematic structure highlights prominent CGAI use cases, including improved user experience in human–computer interaction, computer programs/code generation, and systems creation. Widespread CGAI usefulness for teachers, researchers, and learners includes syllabi/course content generation, testing aids, and academic writing. The concerns about abuse and misuse (plagiarism, academic integrity, privacy violations) and issues about misinformation, danger of self‐diagnoses, and patient privacy in medical/healthcare applications are prominent. Formulating strategies and policies to address potential CGAI challenges in teaching/learning and practice are priorities. Developing discipline‐based automatic detection of GenAI contents to check abuse is proposed.

"While generative artificial intelligence (AI) empowers students in their learning, it may also have the potential to undermine their learning agency. Understanding student learning agency in the generative AI-supported contexts (SLA-GAI) has become critical for educators. However, student learning agency is a domain-specific construct, current scales neglect the specific generative AI situations. Therefore, current scales are considered inapplicable for measuring SLA-GAI. This study aims to conceptualize the student learning agency and develop and validate the SLA-GAI scale. We conducted an exploratory sequential design with two stages. In the first stage, a literature review and group interview with experts were conducted to conceptualize the student learning agency and generate initial items. 268 valid samples from university students were then collected and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to adjust the initial items. In the second stage, 425 valid samples were collected and randomly split into two subsamples (n1 = 268, n2 = 245) to conduct EFA and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), respectively. The findings indicate that the SLA-GAI scale includes ten factors with 34 items. Four of these -- self-cognition, goal setting, self-adjustment and self-reflection -- represent the key ability dimension of the SLA-GAI scale. The other three factors -- selective action, responsible action and participative action represent the active action dimension of the SLA-GAI scale. Finally, self-efficacy and volition present the essential mental characteristics of the SLA-GAI scale. The developed SLA-GAI scale can reflect the latest and abundant meaning of the student learning agency in generative AI-supported contexts.

"The rapid advancement of generative AI technologies is increasingly accompanied by their broader application across various sectors, particularly within creative industries. In this study, IBM Watson BEAT software, based on generative AI technology, was tested as an educational tool in the process of teaching music composition theory to flute students. The Revised Two Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R SPQ 2 F) was employed to investigate predominant learning approaches among study participants. Comparison of pre- and post-test results using the paired and independent samples t-statistics demonstrated significant improvements among students in the experimental group in the deep motive index (increase from 11.74 to 12.86, t = -2.013, p = 0.000) and the surface motive index (decrease from 12.87 to 11.66, t = 2.213, p = 0.002), which correspond to motivational foundations for choosing learning strategies, as well as in the complexity index of the musical compositions created (increase from 3.56 to 4.79, t = -2.146, p = 0.000). However, no significant impact on indices corresponding to practical strategies of learning behavior (deep strategy and surface strategy) was observed, indicating that the duration of the educational intervention may have been insufficient to induce lasting changes in study habits.

"This research examines differences in consumer responses to large language model AI chatbots versus search engines when reviewing and evaluating product information in the information search stage of the purchase decision process. Building on the mere exposure effect, the consumer–brand relationships literature, and consumer decision-making research, this research investigates consumer search preferences and self-disclosure willingness along with a psychological mechanism. We conducted an experiment comparing two types of product search tools and tested a moderated mediation using Process Model 15. The findings suggest that consumers prefer search engines over AI chatbots and are more willing to self-disclose their personal information to search engines (vs. AI chatbots) due to perceived familiarity. However, we find that the quality of consumers' relationship with the source of information moderates this effect. Further, we show that consumers evaluate AI chatbot-based results as less biased than traditional search engine results. Contrary to previous research that has mainly focused on AI chatbots' functional aspects in consumer adoption, the current research emphasizes the psychological and relational aspects of product search perception and preference. In this way, we offer novel insights into a purchase decision-making process and consumer engagement as consumers adopt AI chatbot technology for product search.","Kim, Soyoung; Priluck, Randi",Business Source Ultimate,,10.3390/jtaer20020093,62mx5iucrv,,,2,Journal of Theoretical &amp; Applied Electronic Commerce Research,,,93,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=62mx5iucrv&recordId=62mx5iucrv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,MDPI,Consumer goods; Consumer behavior; Consumer preferences; All Other Consumer Goods Rental; Language models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Chatbots,Consumer Responses to Generative AI Chatbots Versus Search Engines for Product Evaluation.,20
"To enhance teaching practices and lecture strategies, online lecturers need reliable and opportunity feedback. Post-observation feedback provides opportunities for reflection, dialogue, development, and helping lecturers to improve their teaching practices. However, this poses a significant challenge in online higher education due to traditional observation procedures requiring previously trained observers, rendering them expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the observation process has human biases such as those introduced in annotated data by trained observers. Automated solutions powered by Artificial Intelligence offer a viable alternative providing consistency and affordability, delivering actionable feedback to lecturers, thereby helping to improve their pedagogical techniques and supporting student success. Hence, analyzing the video conferencing of the lecturers in online courses would help provide feedback to instructors and insights about teaching practices to institutional leadership. Therefore, this Work in Progress describes a proof of concept on a speech processing pipeline for providing post-observation feedback using Generative Artificial Intelligence to support the reflection process about online higher education teachers' practices.","Cheuquepan-Maldonado, Diego; Gonzalez-Ibanez, Roberto",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016321,h2puwd5laj,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,3,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Pipelines; Semantics; Observers; Rendering (computer graphics); Reflection; Speech processing; Videoconferences; Speech to text; automated feedback; online education; teaching practices; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; video conferencing,Work-in-Progress: Facilitating Automated Feedback of Online Video Conferencing Through Generative Artificial Intelligence,
"Respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and tuberculosis pose significant global health challenges. Accurate and efficient classification of these conditions is vital for improving patient care and optimizing healthcare resources. This study presents a hybrid deep learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance lung sound analysis for diagnosing respiratory diseases. The proposed system follows a structured approach comprising three key stages: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In the preprocessing stage, lung sound recordings undergo resampling, noise reduction, segmentation, and augmentation to improve data quality. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are employed to address data scarcity by synthesizing realistic lung sound samples. Feature extraction is performed using log-scaled mel spectrograms, capturing both spectral and temporal information essential for identifying respiratory patterns. The classification model leverages CNNs for spatial feature learning and LSTMs for capturing sequential dependencies, resulting in a high classification accuracy of 99.6%, surpassing conventional CNN-based approaches. Additionally, the system incorporates explainability techniques, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), to highlight significant spectral features influencing predictions, enhancing transparency and aiding clinical validation. By automating respiratory disease detection, this approach enables rapid, cost-effective, and non-invasive screening, reducing the dependence on specialized medical expertise, particularly in resource-limited healthcare settings. The proposed method aligns with clinical standards, contributing to early diagnosis and improved disease management.","Jyothi, S. Aruna; Rao, Y. B. Shankar; Kumari, N.

"Skin cancer remains a global health challenge, with early detection vital to reducing mortality. This paper proposes a dual-stream deep learning framework for classifying seven skin lesion types from dermatoscopic images. The architecture combines ResNet101 and DenseNet121 to capture both hierarchical and multi-scale texture features. To tackle data imbalance, we apply adaptive histogram equalization, SMOTE, and focal loss. Feature fusion is performed via a dynamic attention mechanism, reducing parameter redundancy by 30% compared to standard concatenation. Validated on 1,532 real-world cases, the model achieves 95.2% accuracy, 0.983 AUC, and 93.9% sensitivity for melanoma detection, with 93.4% concordance with histopathology. It shows strong generalization across Fitzpatrick skin types (≤5% variance) and runs in 87 ms on ARM devices using TensorFlow Lite. Clinically, it reduces diagnostic latency in rural clinics from 14 days to 23 seconds. This work delivers a scalable, interpretable, and bias-aware AI tool for global skin cancer screening.

"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has developed as an effective tool for time series predicting, revolutionizing the typical methods of prediction. Different classical approaches that depend on existing approaches and assumptions, generative AI controls advanced deep learning (DL) approaches like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to identify designs and connections in time series data. DL has accomplished major success in optimizing performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation approaches, and set of optimizers. Stock market predictive is the most important use case in this field. GANs with advanced AI approaches have become more significant in recent times. However, it can be utilized in image‐image‐translation and other computer vision (CV) conditions. GANs could not utilized greatly for stock market prediction because of their effort to establish the proper set of hyperparameters. This study develops an integrated spotted hyena optimization algorithm with generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting (SHOAGAI‐TSF) technique. The purpose of the SHOAGAI‐TSF technique is to accomplish a forecasting process for the utilization of stock price prediction. The SHOAGAI‐TSF technique uses probabilistic forecasting with a conditional GAN (CGAN) approach for the prediction of stock prices. The CGAN model learns the data generation distribution and determines the probabilistic prediction from it. To boost the prediction results of the CGAN approach, the hyperparameter tuning can be performed by the use of the SHOA. The simulation result analysis of the SHOAGAI‐TSF technique takes place on the stock market dataset. The experimental outcomes determine the significant solution of the SHOAGAI‐TSF algorithm with other compared methods in terms of distinct metrics.","Salama, Reda",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1111/exsy.13681,mrr4wh2dun,,,2,Expert Systems,,13,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=mrr4wh2dun&recordId=mrr4wh2dun&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250201,Wiley-Blackwell,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Recurrent neural networks; Computer vision; Optimization algorithms,Integrating spotted hyena optimization technique with generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting.,42

"Research Summary: Strategic decisions are uncertain and often irreversible. Hence, predicting the value of alternatives is important for strategic decision making. We investigate the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in evaluating strategic alternatives using business models generated by AI (study 1) or submitted to a competition (study 2). Each study uses a sample of 60 business models and examines agreement in business model rankings made by large language models (LLMs) and those by human experts. We consider multiple LLMs, assumed LLM roles, and prompts. We find that generative AI often produces evaluations that are inconsistent and biased. However, when aggregating evaluations, AI rankings tend to resemble those of human experts. This study highlights the value of generative AI in strategic decision making by providing predictions. Managerial Summary: Managers are seeking to create value by integrating generative AI into their organizations. We show how managers can use generative AI to help evaluate strategic decisions. Generative AI's single evaluations are often inconsistent or biased. However, if managers aggregate many evaluations across LLMs, prompts, or roles, the results show that the resulting evaluations tend to resemble those of human experts. This approach allows managers to obtain insight on strategic decisions across a variety of domains with relatively low investments in time or resources, which can be combined with human inputs.","Doshi, Anil R.; Bell, J.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool in education, offering scalable individualized learning. However, there is a lack of theoretically informed and methodologically rigorous research on how GenAI can effectively augment learning. This manuscript addresses this gap by investigating the potential of a theory-informed GenAI chatbot, ChatTutor--designed for students--to facilitate generative sense-making by leveraging principles from generative learning theory. The study aimed to (1) extend theory by proposing how GenAI can support generative sense-making and (2) test its effects on conceptual knowledge, self-efficacy, and trust post-use and on conceptual knowledge, enjoyment, and behavioral intentions in a delayed follow-up. We conducted two between-subjects design experiments. Study 1 was a pre-registered experiment with 175 university students in an authentic cognitive psychology course, comparing ChatTutor with a generic GenAI system (ChatGPT) and a teaching-as-usual control. Study 2 replicated the design with 234 high school students, comparing ChatTutor to ChatGPT, and a re-study control. Results showed that ChatTutor significantly enhanced trust and enjoyment in both studies, and behavioral intentions in Study 1, compared to ChatGPT. It also improved conceptual knowledge over ChatGPT immediately in both studies and at follow-up in Study 2. ChatTutor outperformed the control condition in conceptual knowledge, although this difference was only significant in the follow-up of Study 1 and the immediate test of Study 2. Differences in self-efficacy were not significant. The research underscores the importance of integrating human-centered design and educational psychology theories into GenAI applications and offers directions for future research and practice.",Guido Makransky; Ban M.

"This study examines the use of AI tools within work environments, particularly Generative AI (Gen-AI). Its objective is to comprehend the factors affecting employees' adoption and utilization of such tools. The research applies the Technology, Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework to pinpoint potential factors and formulate hypotheses regarding their influence on employees' Gen-AI usage frequency. A quantitative research approach was conducted among a sample of 316 American employees. Results suggest that employees' perceived Gen-AI intelligence and warmth positively impact their usage through the mediation of performance expectancy. Effort expectancy only mediates the relationship between perceived Gen-AI intelligence and Gen-AI employee usage. Findings also show that the perceived severity of Gen-AI has a negative influence on employees' usage and that an organization's absorptive capacity of Gen-AI does not influence employees' usage. Critical drivers for Gen-AI utilization encompass technological proficiency, peer influence, and regulatory backing. These outcomes underscore the significance of nurturing a corporate culture that encourages innovation and adherence to regulations to successfully integrate Gen-AI in workplaces.","Zaoui, Ishraf; Hallem, Yousra; Nasr, Imed Ben; Bougatfa, Sonia",Business Source Ultimate,,10.22059/jitm.2025.100696,hzmxuw2vvn,,,,Journal of Information Technology Management (JITM),,54,24,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=hzmxuw2vvn&recordId=hzmxuw2vvn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250102,"University of Tehran, Faculty of Management",Corporate culture; Quantitative research; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Peer pressure,Enhancing Generative AI Usage for Employees: Key Drivers and Barriers.,17

"Recent transition in mobile communication standards suggests massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to be an integral part of the foreseeable future. However, as antenna elements increase to hundreds in the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond, traditional signal processing methods become prone to significant hardware impairments compound from multiple chains, leading to a substantial performance degradation. This paper explores the effectiveness of generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in addressing these challenges within massive MIMO systems. For this purpose, the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), a special class of generative AI algorithms, is employed to enhance the accuracy of channel state information (CSI) estimation in a hardware-impaired transceiver setup. This problem is treated as an image-denoising task, where the noise is introduced by the hardware impairments and LS estimation error. Through simulations conducted across various antenna array sizes, the potential of generative AI to improve CSI estimation accuracy under hardware impairments is demon-strated. This highlights its capacity to address critical signal processing challenges in the next-generation wireless systems.","Banerjee, Bitan; Nimr, Ahmad; Fettweis, Gerhard",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/WCNC61545.2025.10978320,qmbaigy3cr,,,,"2025 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), 2025 IEEE",,6,1,,True,20250324,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Array signal processing; Massive MIMO; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Throughput; Hardware; Transceivers; Next generation networking; Antenna arrays; channel estimation; machine learning (ML); <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; conditional <mark>generative</mark> adversarial networks (CGAN)",Overcoming Hardware Limitations in Massive MIMO: A Generative AI Take,

"Ancient buildings, as an integral part of human cultural heritage, face tilting issues that not only affect their aesthetic appeal but may also lead to structural instability or even collapse, posing serious threats to building safety and human lives. Traditional monitoring methods rely on physical sensors and manual inspections, which suffer from limitations such as data scarcity, low prediction accuracy, and poor real-time performance. To address these challenges, this study proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based tilting prediction model for ancient buildings. By leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, diverse combinations of tilting and contributing factor data are generated, effectively resolving the issue of data scarcity. The model adopts a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, with inputs including contributing factors such as foundation settlement, vibration frequency, temperature, and humidity, and outputs including tilt angles and tilt rates, enabling accurate capture of complex nonlinear relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability, and its effectiveness is validated through a real-world monitoring system.

"Heart failure (HF) poses critical global health challenges, emphasizing the need for robust predictive models to support early diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes. Traditional machine learning (ML) models, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting Machines (xGBM), have shown effectiveness but face limitations in handling nonlinear relationships, addressing class imbalances, and generalizing across datasets. Deep learning (DL) models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), excel at identifying complex patterns but are hindered by computational requirements and limited interpretability, restricting clinical adoption. This research evaluates predictive models using nine datasets ranging from 299 to 400,000 records. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to address class imbalances, while a Stacking Generative AI (GenAI) model was developed. This hybrid model integrates Generative AI with RF, GBM, and CNNs, enhancing underrepresented subgroup representation through synthetic data generation. The Stacking Generative AI model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 98% accuracy and a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) of 0.999 on a 1,025-record dataset. These results highlight the model's ability to handle complex data, enhance predictive accuracy, and improve clinical relevance.

"An essential component of sustainable development is water quality management, which requires accurate monitoring and forecasting capabilities. Conventional methods for assessing water quality often face challenges such as sparse data, sensor inaccuracies, and real-time processing limitations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Smart IoT-Enabled Water Quality Management System that integrates Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SR-GAN) with artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced monitoring and prediction. The system utilizes IoT -based smart sensors to collect real-time data on temperature, turbidity, oxygen concentration, pH levels, and other water quality parameters.SR-GAN enhances both the temporal and spatial resolution of low-quality sensor data, enabling better feature extraction and more precise information. Generative AI models are then employed for automated decision-making, anomaly detection, and forecasting, effectively identifying potential water pollution threats. Compared to conventional AI and deep learning methods, the proposed framework achieves superior performance in terms of response time efficiency (30% improvement), data quality, and prediction accuracy (98.7%). The integration of edge computing ensures low latency and real-time data processing. This innovative approach significantly enhances water quality monitoring accuracy, facilitating proactive measures and sustainable water resource management.","D, Shofia Priyadharshini; Ramesh, G.P.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICICACS65178.2025.10968178,b54jja5qnb,,,,"2025 3rd International Conference on Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems (ICICACS), Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems (ICICACS), 2025 3rd International Conference on",,07,01,,True,20250221,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Temperature sensors; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Superresolution; Water quality; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Real-time systems; Reliability; Monitoring; Anomaly detection; smart IoT; water quality management; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; super-resolution GAN; predictive analytics; edge computing; anomaly detection; environmental monitoring; deep learning; sensor data enhancement",Smart IoT-enabled Water Quality Management using Generative AI and Super-Resolution GAN for Enhanced Monitoring and Prediction,

"This paper explores how Generative AI can transform Design for Safety &amp; Reliability (DfSR) by proactively identifying and mitigating risks throughout the product development lifecycle. It examines three key approaches to leveraging generative AI in DfSR: Assistive Ai: This approach employs Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to interact dynamically with users. While highly flexible and agile, interpretability and control of AI-generated outputs remain areas of concern. Potential applications include providing diverse perspectives during brainstorming sessions. Scripted Ai: This approach uses predefined rules and scripts to automate repetitive tasks to improve the efficiency and consistency. However, its inflexibility limits its effectiveness in complex scenarios. We suggest using Scripted AI to automate routine tasks. Agentic Ai: This approach involves AI systems autonomously executing tasks, demonstrating a higher degree of “agency”. While offering real-time analysis and continuous learning capabilities, ethical considerations and system complexity present challenges. The paper highlights how these approaches can be applied across various stages of the DfSR workflow, from defining requirements and planning to risk assessment, design optimization, and sustainment. Each stage benefits from the unique strengths of each AI approach. We also emphasize the limitations of Generative AI tools. We recommend maintaining human oversight in critical decisions, treating AI as collaborators, and continuously monitoring AI systems for reliability and performance. As AI technology advances, its integration into engineering workflows promises safer, more reliable, and innovative products. Continued research and development in AI will be crucial for realizing the full potential of AI in shaping the future of DfSR.","Hu, Yunwei; N A, Amith Nag; Yellamati, David Deepak; Goktas, Yavuz",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/RAMS48127.2025.10935137,mjyrxx5g4b,,,,"2025 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS), Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS), 2025 Annual",,6,1,,True,20250127,IEEE,"Aerospace; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Random access memory; Transforms; Reliability engineering; Real-time systems; Safety; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Research and development; Risk mitigation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (Gen <mark>AI</mark>); Machine Learning; Large Language Models (LLM)",Leveraging Generative AI Tools for Proactive Risk Mitigation in Design,
"The fashion business is growing quickly and is one of the main forces behind the world's economies. The everexpanding business is driving a significant rise in the application of computer science to address various issues inside it. It becomes difficult to discover a personalized wardrobe that reflects their preferences, taste and needs. Traditional Fashion Recommendation Systems (FRSs) limits their ability to scale and adapt the ever growing styles as they heavily rely on manual design. Fashion can also be so inclusive, expressive and sustainable. Appropriate recommendations given by FRS helps to enhance user satisfaction and makes it more enjoyable and accessible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have revolutionized FRS enabling them to consume beyond conventional methods by taking in contextual data, user preferences and visual content for recommendations with a more individualized suggestion. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent technique to enhance these systems by generating diverse fashion designs with high fidelity. In this paper, a systematic review of parameters used to evaluate FRS using Generative Algorithms is discussed. Various parameters to evaluate system performance and the recommendation quality are analyzed. Detailed analysis of the input parameters, to be considered to design the efficient AI based FRS (AI-FRS) is also presented.

"There is a heightened concern over undergraduate students being over-reliant on Generative AI and using it recklessly. Reliance behaviours describe the frequencies and ways that people use AI tools for tasks such as problem-solving, influenced by individual factors such as trust and AI literacy. One way to conceptualise reliance is that reliance behaviours are affected by the extent to which learners consciously evaluate the relative performance of AI and humans, suggesting the potential impacts of critical thinking on reliance. This study, thus, empirically investigates the relationship between critical thinking and reliance behaviours. Critical thinking includes disposition and skills. However, limited empirical studies have investigated how critical thinking influences learners' reliance behaviours when solving problems with Generative AI. Hence, the current study conducted path analyses to investigate how critical thinking is associated with reliance behaviours and how it mediates the effect of individual factors on reliance behaviours. We collected 808 survey responses on critical thinking disposition and skills, reliance behaviours (a self-developed and validated scale, including reflective use, cautious use, thoughtless use, and collaborative use), trust towards AI, and AI literacy from undergraduates after a problem-solving task with Generative AI. The results indicate that (1) critical thinking is positively associated with the collaborative, reflective, and cautious use of Generative AI, suggesting that these three types of use of Generative AI could be considered desirable behaviours in human-AI problem-solving; (2) trust positively predicts thoughtless use; (3) critical thinking can offset the influence of trust on collaborative, reflective and cautious use; and (4) critical thinking can amplify the influence of AI literacy on reflective, cautious and collaborative use. This study contributes new insights into understanding the role of critical thinking in fostering desirable reliance behaviours, including reflective, cautious and collaborative use, and provides implications for future interventions when applying Generative AI for problem-solving.",Chenyu Hou; Gaoxia Zhu; Vidya Sudarshan,ERIC,,10.1111/bjet.13613,t6g2janx7v,,,5,British Journal of Educational Technology,,1941,1919,,True,20250901,,Undergraduate Students; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Student Behavior; Incidence; Critical Thinking; Thinking Skills; Problem Solving; Technology Uses in Education; Trust (Psychology); Problem Based Learning; Flipped Classroom; Foreign Countries; Technological Literacy; Cooperation; Asia,The Role of Critical Thinking on Undergraduates' Reliance Behaviours on Generative AI in Problem-Solving,56
"The rapid rise of Generative AI in education has brought transformative potential. However, there is limited empirical insight into the factors influencing students' use of these tools and their impact on academic performance. Specifically, research has not thoroughly examined how task-technology fit and behavioral factors shape Generative AI usage. This study addresses these gaps by integrating the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to develop a theoretical research model. Data were collected from university students through a structured survey, and the model was validated using a hybrid Structural Equation Modeling-Artificial Neural Network (SEM-ANN) approach. The results demonstrate that both task and technology characteristics significantly impact task-technology fit, positively influencing the use of Generative AI tools. Additionally, behavioral factors such as attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were found to strongly encourage Generative AI usage. Notably, the study confirms that these AI tools positively contribute to students' academic performance.

"AI-generative tools, such as ChatGPT, are argued to hold the potential to contribute to creative thinking in education broadly and second language education specifically. Nonetheless, existing literature underscores a critical requirement to elucidate the specific nature of this contribution among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) undergraduates utilizing ChatGPT. Therefore, the study aims to explore students' perspectives on how AI can contribute to creativity in an EFL learning context. The descriptive-survey method was used to achieve this objective. A convenient sample of (546) students responded to a perceptually closed-item questionnaire on how AI-generative tools contribute to creativity in the EFL context from university students' points of view. Also, a purposive sample sat for an online semi-structured interview to elicit information on the best practices to utilizing generative AI in nurturing creativity in learning English. The study revealed that ChatGPT uniquely contributes to enhancing creativity in EFL education. Students recognized the potential of these tools for conversation practice, idea generation, feedback on writing, vocabulary building, and collaborative learning. However, concerns were raised about over-reliance on AI, critical thinking, accuracy, and intellectual property. Differences in students' perceptions based on gender, specialization, and academic year were also noted, indicating varying levels of comfort and engagement with AI tools. This research demonstrates how AI can be strategically integrated to foster creativity while addressing critical challenges such as the balance between human and AI-generated input, the need for training on ethical AI use, and the importance of mitigating biases in AI-generated content. The findings suggest that promoting responsible and creative use of AI in EFL education--through comprehensive training, continuous monitoring, and collaboration among educators--can enhance learning outcomes, support innovation, and uphold academic integrity.

"Despite the critical role teachers play in AI education, research on their understanding of generative AI tools remains limited, particularly concerning their ethical assessment knowledge. This study addresses the gap by proposing the Generative AI Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (GenAI-TPACK) framework, which incorporates ethical knowledge as an essential component of university teachers' professional development. Grounded in the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, we utilize structural equation modeling to investigate the interrelationships among Generative AI Technological Knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and ethical assessment knowledge. Our findings indicate that university teachers' effective use of generative AI is contingent upon their technological knowledge and engagement with these tools.

"This research presents a generative AI mechanism designed to assist artists in finding inspiration and developing ideas during their creative process by leveraging their emotions as a driving force. The proposed iterative inspiration cycle, complete with feedback loops, helps artists digitally capture their creative emotions and use them as a guiding ""vision"" for creating artwork. Within the mechanism, the ""Emotion Vision"" images, generated from sketch line drawings and creative emotion prompts, are a medium designed to inspire artists. Experimental results demonstrate a positive inspirational effect, particularly in the creation of 'Abstract Expressionism' and 'Impressionism' artworks. In addition, we introduce the Emotion Vision Score metric, which quantifies the effectiveness of emotional inspiration. This metric evaluates how well ""Emotion Vision"" images inspire artists by balancing sketch intentions, creative emotions, and inspirational diversity, thus identifying the most effective images for inspiration. This novel mechanism integrates emotional intelligence into AI for art creation, allowing it to understand and replicate human emotion in its outputs.

"Generative AI (GenAI) technologies have been widely adopted by college students since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. While the debate about GenAI's role in higher education continues, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding whether and when these technologies can improve the learning experience for college students. This study utilizes data from a survey of 72,615 undergraduate students across 25 universities and colleges in China to explore the relationships between GenAI use and student learning engagement in different learning environments. The findings reveal that over sixty percent of Chinese college students use GenAI technologies in Academic Year 2023–2024, with academic use exceeding daily use. GenAI use in academic tasks is related to more cognitive and emotional engagement, though it may also reduce active learning activities and learning motivation. Furthermore, this study highlights that the role of GenAI varies across learning environments. The positive associations of GenAI and student engagement are most prominent for students in ""high-challenge and high-support"" learning contexts, while GenAI use is mostly negatively associated with student engagement in ""low-challenge, high-support"" courses. These findings suggest that while GenAI plays a valuable role in the learning process for college students, its effectiveness is fundamentally conditioned by the instructional design of human teachers.","Guo, Fei; Zhang, Lanwen; Shi, Tianle; Coates, Hamish",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/bs15081011,d3abiisv7r,,,8,Behavioral Sciences (2076-328X),,,1011,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=d3abiisv7r&recordId=d3abiisv7r&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Student engagement; College students; Participation; Classroom environment; Instructional systems design; Higher education; China,Whether and When Could Generative AI Improve College Student Learning Engagement?,15
"Introduction: With the increasing accessibility of tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek, Dall-E, and Gemini, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has been poised as a potential, research timesaving tool, especially for synthesising evidence. Our objective was to determine whether GenAI can assist with evidence synthesis by assessing its performance using its accuracy, error rates, and time savings compared to the traditional expert-driven approach. Methods: To systematically review the evidence, we searched five databases on 17 January 2025, synthesised outcomes reporting on the accuracy, error rates, or time taken, and appraised the risk-of-bias using a modified version of QUADAS-2. Results: We identified 3,071 unique records, 19 of which were included in our review. Most studies had a high or unclear risk-of-bias in Domain 1A: review selection, Domain 2A: GenAI conduct, and Domain 1B: applicability of results. When used for (1) searching GenAI missed 68% to 96% (median = 91%) of studies, (2) screening made incorrect inclusion decisions ranging from 0% to 29% (median = 10%); and incorrect exclusion decisions ranging from 1% to 83% (median = 28%), (3) incorrect data extractions ranging from 4% to 31% (median = 14%), (4) incorrect risk-of-bias assessments ranging from 10% to 56% (median = 27%). Conclusion: Our review shows that the current evidence does not support GenAI use in evidence synthesis without human involvement or oversight. However, for most tasks other than searching, GenAI may have a role in assisting humans with evidence synthesis.","Clark, Justin; Barton, Belinda; Albarqouni, Loai; Byambasuren, Oyungerel; Jowsey, Tanisha; Keogh, Justin; Liang, Tian; Moro, Christian; O'Neill, Hayley; Jones, Mark",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1017/rsm.2025.16,pby4prbvrv,,,4,Research Synthesis Methods,,619,601,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=pby4prbvrv&recordId=pby4prbvrv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Cambridge University Press,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Error rates; Control groups; Statistical bias; Statistical accuracy; Research methodology,Generative artificial intelligence use in evidence synthesis: A systematic review.,16
"Background: The current research on the application of generative artificial intelligence in has shown rapid growth, and most of the existing research focuses on general nursing scenarios. And is still in the exploratory stage in the specialty field and lacks a systematic compendium of its application in the field of cardiovascular specialty nursing. Objective: A review of studies related to the application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of specialized cardiovascular nursing informing relevant research and practice. Methods: This review was conducted according to the JBI guidelines for scoping reviews, using the PRISMA-ScR reporting tool.The databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, APA PsycNetInfo (Ovid), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, SinoMed, CNKI, WanFang databases, peer-reviewed studies written in English and Chinese from the time of database construction until March 29, 2025. Eligible studies were screened by title and abstract, and full-text screening was performed by two independent evaluators. Results: Nineteen studies were included in this review, and the main application tools were 9 text generation models, 3 multimodal generation models, 4 temporal prediction models, and 3 chatbots. The application scenarios mainly include clinical decision support, patient health management, and nursing education and counseling. Generative artificial intelligence has outstanding effects in reducing nursing workload and precise intervention, but there are limitations in the field of health education and counseling, such as logical disconnection, poor information quality, and lack of humanistic care. Conclusions: Generative artificial intelligence provides technical support for the intelligent transformation of cardiovascular specialty care, especially effective in the areas of clinical decision support and patient health management. There is an urgent need to solve the existing problems to promote its in-depth application in this field, and it is suggested that future research focuses on the construction of specialized multimodal models.","Zheng, Xinglin; Zou, Huina; Wu, Linjing; Dong, Peihuang; Yuan, Wenhui; Chen, Yuan",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1186/s12912-025-03594-9,l7aauism7f,,,1,BMC Nursing,,10,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=l7aauism7f&recordId=l7aauism7f&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250719,BioMed Central,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Medical information storage &amp; retrieval systems; CINAHL database; Descriptive statistics; Systematic reviews; MEDLINE; Nursing research; Medical databases; Cardiovascular disease nursing; Online information services; Psychology information storage &amp; retrieval systems,Generative artificial intelligence in cardiovascular specialty care: a scoping review.,24

"In 2019, UNESCO, through the Beijing Consensus, highlighted that artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly have a huge impact on various sectors of society. Academics such as Thomas Chiu, along with other researchers (2025), believe that most of the population will learn and work with artificial intelligence and argue that it is crucial to teach AI in basic education. The Economic Forum (2025) points out that skills related to artificial intelligence and big data are the fastest growing. According to Russell y Norvig (1995), AI is a field that encompasses several subfields, in addition to inheriting knowledge from other disciplines. Given the emerging need to learn AI in formal education, starting in primary school, this study has verified whether undergraduate education programmes in Brazil are preparing future teachers for the use of AI in teaching. At the same time, based on the principle that AI is a field that encompasses different subfields, we investigated whether undergraduate computer science courses offer multidisciplinary training. To this end, the curricula of the three best education and computer science faculties in Brazil were analysed. According to the results, there is a high degree of specialisation, which makes interdisciplinarity or multidisciplinarity urgent in both courses.","Falcão Botelho, Thaïs Helena; Ett., Gerhard",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.5281/zenodo.15858122,uo3de4fqxj,,,82,Comunicar,,73,62,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=uo3de4fqxj&recordId=uo3de4fqxj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Oxbridge Publishing House,"<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Computer science education; Computer science; Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology); Research and development in the physical, engineering and life sciences; Undergraduate education",Pedagogía sin IA generativa - Ciencias de la Computación sin Ciencias Humanas.,33

"As more users seek generative AI (GAI) models to enhance work efficiency, GAI and Model-as-a-Service will drive transformative changes and upgrades across all industries. However, when users utilize GAI models provided by the service provider, they cannot be certain that the model’s quality matches the provider’s claims. Considering the need to protect intellectual property, the service provider will not disclose model details for user verification. To this end, we take the Internet of Vehicles as research background, proposing a zero knowledge model proof architecture based on UAVs. We also introduce a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the verification process. In specific, we first propose a verification scheme for the key operations of generative adversarial networks based on noninteractive zero knowledge proof. The zero knowledge proof architecture ensures that model parameters cannot be stolen during the verification process. After that, we propose an Age of Verification (AoV) metric to ensure the timeliness and freshness of zero knowledge proof. We also construct a tradeoff optimization problem between the energy consumption of UAV as a verifier and the AoV of edge servers as service providers, and transform the problem based on Lyapunov optimization theory. Following that, we propose an enhanced multiagent proximal policy optimization algorithm to enable the collaborative verification of edge servers by multiple UAVs. The algorithm simulation results demonstrate that the reward value of our proposed algorithm is over 10% higher than that of the standard algorithm, with a faster and more stable overall convergence speed. Additionally, the zero knowledge proof performance test results indicate that the verification delay in our proposed architecture is less than 500 ms during the verification phase, meeting practical requirements.","Hao, M.; Shang, C.; Wang, S.; Jiang, W.; Nie, J.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2025.3531914,mcm7scom5r,,,10,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,13454,13441,,True,20250515,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computational modeling; Servers; Zero knowledge proof; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Optimization; Computer architecture; Data models; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Security; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> (GAI); Lyapunov optimization; multiagent deep reinforcement learning; uncrewed aerial vehicle; zero knowledge proof",UAV-Assisted Zero Knowledge Model Proof for Generative AI: A Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,12
"Mobile edge computing (MEC) enabled artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) has garnered considerable attention. To support AIGC metaverse applications within MEC in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, it is effective to offload computation tasks, particularly those involving neural networks generative in AIGC, from mobile devices to edge clouds. Existing solutions typically assume the availability of a dedicated and powerful edge server for each user with single modal data, which can handle the entire AIGC service offloading. However, the practical availability of such dedicated and powerful servers may be limited, necessitating the utilization of less capable alternatives. Thus, we propose the multimodal parallel offloading AIGC framework which partitions multimodal content and offloads partial diffusion tasks to multiple servers. Our proposed scheme accelerates mobile deep vision multimodal metaverse applications through parallel offloading provided by multiple servers. We further utilize the generative AI scheme to solve offloading problems to adapt the dynamic and available communication and computing resource in wireless IoT network. Our framework proposed a multimodal parallel diffusion offloading scheme with integrating the recurrent region proposal prediction algorithm to optimize communication and computing resources while minimizing delay. Simulation results show that our approach can significantly reduce delay compared to conventional algorithms.","Zeng, W.; Zheng, J.; Gao, L.; Niu, J.; Ren, J.; Wang, H.; Cao, R.; Ji, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2025.3535623,p5zr4o2brf,,,10,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,13285,13273,,True,20250515,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Servers; Metaverse; Resource management; Edge computing; Proposals; Heuristic algorithms; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Wireless communication; Dynamic scheduling; Prediction algorithms; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>-generated content (AIGC); multimodal parallel offloading; region proposal prediction",Generative AI-Aided Multimodal Parallel Offloading for AIGC Metaverse Service in IoT Networks,12

To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a comparative user study analyzing the performance and user satisfaction of GenAI-generated 3D objects compared to those generated by Sketchfab in different immersive contexts. The results suggest that GenAI can significantly complement traditional 3D asset libraries, with valuable design implications for the development of human-centered XR environments.","Stacchio, L.; Balloni, E.; Frontoni, E.; Paolanti, M.; Zingaretti, P.; Pierdicca, R.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TVCG.2025.3549160,jabxknwbfj,,,5,"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"The dramatic increase in smart services makes adaptive management of communication networks more critical. Especially for Internet of Things (IoT) networks, adaptive management faces several challenges, like fluctuating network conditions, heterogeneity in data sources, and rapid response capabilities. These challenges lead to performance degradation and data losses in IoT applications if not handled. Even though traditional AI algorithms are applied in most network topologies, they fall short of handling these adaptive management challenges without requiring additional software developments. Therefore, we propose a Generative AI-powered Digital Twinning (GenTwin) framework to create digital twin models with generative AI algorithms. In this framework, we design two novel mechanisms: Priority Pooling and Twin Adapter. Priority Pooling is to extract the dynamic relations within the topology before performing model training. We theoretically formulate the priority levels and corresponding weights with a novel presence parameter to present a modular architecture to increase training efficiency. The Twin Adapter is to interact with the GAI architecture and fine-tune the model for the adaptive twin modelling task in IoT networks. After creating the adaptive twin models, we test the rapid response capabilities of GenTwin with what-if analysis. According to our simulation results, we note that the proposed pooling mechanism extracts the data relations 19% more by enhancing the training accuracy. In addition, we show that GenTwin surpasses the traditional twin performance in terms of rapid response capabilities by reducing the response time 53% when the dynamicity is maximum.","Duran, K.; Shin, H.; Duong, T.Q.; Canberk, B.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2025.3527719,g7yuiebxyj,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to revolutionise knowledge work and thus innovation management. In order to describe the expected changes, a comprehensive survey was conducted among experts from industry and research. Many of the respondents do not currently see GenAI as playing a relevant role in innovation management. The survey results suggest that GenAI could take on more and more tasks, as a high to very high potential for support from GenAI is expected in all phases of the innovation process. At the same time, challenges are currently also seen in the use of GenAI in innovation management. It is assumed that some of these obstacles will be overcome by technological progress. It is therefore advisable for companies to proactively develop GenAI capabilities in order to understand the complexity of the technology at an early stage and to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. Due to the limited number of participants and their random selection, the study is not representative. Nevertheless, the results provide starting points for further research. For example, comparisons of the expected potentials and challenges of the use of GenAI in innovation management between world regions or longitudinal surveys of actual changes represent relevant research approaches.","Keicher, Lukas; Spitzley, Anne; Ardilio, Antonino; Arnold, Maike",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1515/iwp-2024-2054,qxpqhn7udz,,,2/3,Information -- Wissenschaft und Praxis,,112,104,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=qxpqhn7udz&recordId=qxpqhn7udz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,De Gruyter,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Innovation management; Technological progress; Random numbers,Generative künstliche Intelligenz im Innovationsmanagement: Potenziale und Herausforderungen.,76
"This paper explores the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in designing resilient and flexible “plastic supply networks” that adapt structurally in response to disruptions. Traditional supply chain management approaches often aim to restore pre-disruption conditions, lacking the capacity for significant structural reconfiguration. By contrast, plastic networks enable adaptability, allowing for proactive restructuring to meet evolving demands and counter unforeseen challenges. Generative AI enhances this adaptability, offering data-driven solutions that continuously optimize supply chain configurations through real-time analyses of supplier performance, logistics, and market trends. These AI-driven networks can dynamically alter routes, supplier relationships, and inventory strategies, responding efficiently to geopolitical, environmental, and economic shifts. This study contributes to supply chain resilience literature by positioning AI as a catalyst for network plasticity, fostering agility and sustainability within supply ecosystems. Finally, we address the computational, data quality, and ethical challenges associated with AI implementation, highlighting areas for future research and governance in creating resilient, adaptive supply chains.","Guntuka, Laharish; Carnovale, Steven",Business Source Ultimate,,10.57198/2583-4932.1345,6pi7v5uhuz,,,1,Management Dynamics,,20,15,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=6pi7v5uhuz&recordId=6pi7v5uhuz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250101,"Jaipuria Institute of Management, Lucknow",Supply chains; Economic trends; Supply chain management; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Resilient design; Data quality,Plasticity in Supply Networks: Leveraging Generative AI for Flexible and Resilient Supply Chain Design.,25
"With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. However, GenAI models with billions of parameters require substantial memory capacity and computational power for deployment and execution, presenting significant challenges to resource-limited edge networks. In this paper, we address the joint model caching and resource allocation problem in GenAI-enabled wireless edge networks. Our objective is to balance the trade-off between delivering high-quality AIGC and minimizing the delay in AI GC service provisioning. To tackle this problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning approach, capable of efficiently determining optimal model caching and resource allocation decisions for AIGC services in response to user mobility and time-varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that DDPG achieves a higher model hit ratio and provides superior-quality, lower-latency AIGC services compared to other benchmark solutions.","Liu, Zhang; Du, Hongyang; Huang, Lianfen; Gao, Zhibin; Niyato, Dusit",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/WCNC61545.2025.10978225,aemoepaqqz,,,,"2025 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), 2025 IEEE",,6,1,,True,20250324,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Wireless communication; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Noise reduction; Memory management; Reinforcement learning; Time-varying channels; Numerical models; Resource management; Low latency communication; <mark>AI</mark>-generated contents; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; model caching; resource allocation; wireless edge networks",Joint Model Caching and Resource Allocation in Generative AI - Enabled Wireless Edge Networks,

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the landscape of three-dimensional (3D) printing by enabling generative approaches that extend beyond conventional, parameter-tuning strategies. Rather than merely adjusting nozzle temperatures or speeds, modern AI models can create or refine Gcode paths themselves, seeking to balance objectives such as print strength, dimensional accuracy, and defect minimization. This paper introduces a holistic AI-driven workflow for automated Gcode generation. We demonstrate that generative Large Language Models (LLMs) can parse, synthesize, and optimize printing instructions, thus offering an alternative to human-engineered slicing parameters. Our approach incorporates a continuous feedback loop in which a predictive model evaluates each generated Gcode script for potential print outcomes. Experimental results illustrate strong correlations between the number of lines in generated Gcode and key performance metrics (tensile strength, defect rate, and dimensional accuracy). Notably, some scripts with fewer lines reduced material defects yet slightly degraded dimensional accuracy, while more complex scripts improved measurement fidelity but also introduced minor flaws. These findings illuminate the trade-offs in AI-driven 3D printing and highlight the method's capacity for ongoing improvement. By exploring future expansions, such as continuous-function printing trajectories and multi-material prints, this study shows that AI-based Gcode generation can significantly advance 3D printing quality and customization across diverse applications.","Haque, Sean; Tanveer, Muhammad Hassan; Voicu, Razvan Cristian",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SoutheastCon56624.2025.10971689,7al4gzcymj,,,,"SoutheastCon 2025, 2025, SoutheastCon",,1287,1282,,True,20250322,IEEE,"Aerospace; Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas; Engineering Profession; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Geoscience; Nuclear Engineering; Photonics and Electrooptics; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Solid modeling; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Machine learning; Predictive models; Three-dimensional printing; Minimization; Trajectory; Optimization; 3D Printing; Gcode; Machine Learning; Print Optimization; <mark>AI</mark> Generated 3D Models; Additive Manufacturing",AI-Driven 3D Printing: Generative Gcode for Quality and Efficiency,
"This paper proposes a personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence, which aims to improve students' learning efficiency and interest through adaptive learning paths and content recommendations. The system integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies such as GAN and VAE to achieve deep customization and dynamic adjustment of the learning process. First, the GAN model is used to generate personalized learning resources, including courseware, exercises and learning paths, which are dynamically adjusted according to students' knowledge mastery and learning styles. VAE is used to construct a latent space representation of students' learning status and further optimize the personalized recommendation of learning content. To verify the effectiveness of the system, this paper conducted many simulation experiments. By analyzing the learning behavior data of different student groups, the system's performance in personalized recommendation and learning progress adaptation was evaluated. The experimental results show that the personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence has significant advantages in improving students' learning effects, shortening learning time, and increasing learning participation.

"This paper presents two pedagogical approaches for teaching in the era of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), using case studies from mathematics and computer science. As Generation Z and Alpha have grown up immersed in technology, their learning styles differ significantly from previous generations, creating challenges for traditional instructional methods. While digital platforms provide flexibility, accessibility, and interactivity, the rapid advancement of generative AI adds new layers of complexity. These AI tools enhance self-learning and problem-solving but also raise concerns about ethical usage and conceptual depth.

"Personalized learning has significantly enhanced teaching practice through its development to cater to varied learning needs and in its full utilization of learner engagement. Traditional practice, in contrast, is limited by fixed content, minimum learner flexibility, and minimal immediate feedback. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a revolution through self-generated adaptive learning material such as customized tests, interactive simulations, and adaptive lesson plans. This article presents a systematic review on the use of Generative AI in education, synthesizing what has been published on its contributions to learning achievement based on empirical studies. Studies conducted by AI-powered platforms like Khan Academy's AI tutor and Duolingo's adaptive questions indicate a 26-38% boost in student engagement, a 34% boost in learning retention, and a 40% decrease in teacher workloads. Additionally, current evidence shows that adaptive learning models implemented using AI cut dropout rates by 22% and improved evaluation accuracy through live automated feedback. Despite these advantages, data confidentiality, algorithm bias, and material reliability concerns continue to exist. This paper fills this gap through the discussion of ethical AI platforms, the usage of open-sourced datasets in minimizing bias, and Explainable AI (XAI) as a means for transparency. Moreover, it explores hybrid AI-human models of education, scalability of AI-powered education in developing regions, and policy recommendations for affordable education.

"Generative AI models have transformed content creation by enabling high-quality image and data synthesis. However, these models often inherit and amplify societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to concerns about fairness in their applications. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a comprehensive framework for identifying, measuring and reducing bias in generative AI systems.

"The rapid evolution of network technologies and frequent network intrusions have amplified the demand for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) powered by artificial intelligence (AI). However, the performance of IDSs is limited by labeled intrusion data and class imbalances in existing datasets. Collecting such data through live network simulations is costly, insecure, and poses regulatory challenges. This paper presents a multi-model framework that uses a conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) to synthesize realistic network intrusion data. The framework addresses challenges such as unstable training, mode collapse, and handling mixed data types, which are common in most generative AI models when applied to non-Gaussian tabular data generation while validating the synthesized data through qualitative and quantitative analyses. Overlaid density histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are used for qualitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, the train-real-test-synthetic (TRTS) and train-synthetic-test-real (TSTR) methods, as well as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, are utilized. The TRTS and TSTR methods are classifier-based approaches with classification accuracies of 98.36% and 97.95%, respectively, and are used to assess the synthesized intrusion data to ensure the interchangeability of the synthesized intrusion data and real-world intrusion data for training IDSs. The KS test results indicate a similarity score of 0.92 between real and synthesized data. Additionally, to provide interpretable insights into the performance of the model and refrain from using real-world intrusion data for analysis purposes, the framework employs an explainable AI (XAI) approach called local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME), enabling network security analysts to interpret features that influence the intrusive nature of the synthesized network intrusion data while preserving data privacy.","Rathakrishnan, Mathushaharan; Gayan, Samiru; Edirisinghe, Sampath; Inaltekin, Hazer",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICARC64760.2025.10963129,eqg6mpqruv,,,,"2025 5th International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC), Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC), 2025 5th International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250219,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Analytical models; Histograms; Statistical analysis; Explainable <mark>AI</mark>; Scalability; Intrusion detection; Network security; Data models; Network intrusion; Intrusion detection systems; <mark>generative</mark> adversarial networks; multi-model framework; explainable <mark>AI</mark>; data privacy",A Multi-Model Framework for Synthesizing High-Fidelity Network Intrusion Data Using Generative AI,
"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus, causing progressive retinal damage and, if left untreated, leading to permanent blindness. Early detection is critical for effective treatment; however, the current manual diagnostic process performed by ophthalmologists is both time-intensive and reliant on highly trained professionals. This approach faces numerous challenges, including its inefficiency in detecting early-stage DR and the growing global prevalence of the disease. To address these limitations, the adoption of automated, efficient, and accurate detection methods is imperative. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) algorithms have significantly improved the performance of commercial DR detection systems, enabling more precise diagnoses. This study examines the challenges associated with traditional DR detection and classification, particularly in the early stages, and explores the transformative potential of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). By leveraging technologies like chat generative pre-trained transformers (e.g., ChatGPT), GAI can enhance clinical workflows by generating detailed medical reports, educating patients, and analyzing extensive datasets to uncover actionable insights.

"In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), native generative AI (GenAI) has become prominent in generating intelligent cyber-attacks in a smart grid environment by imitating operational parameters and metrics. As a result, it is imperative to understand the attack generation capabilities of native GenAI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Autoencoders in a smart grid environment. This research aims to explore the potential of GenAI models to accurately imitate and analyze the behavior of cyberattacks within a smart grid environment. The goal is to understand the risks posed by these intelligent attacks while developing strategies to protect against disruptive Distributed Energy Resources (DER) events, such as incorrect load shifting, imbalanced demand supply, and unstable price forecasting. First, this work leverages two customized native GenAI models, namely GAN and Autoencoder, to synthesize DERs control message parameters such as nominal power consumption, price elasticity coefficients, and communication data packets, among others, to introduce highly unpredictable new intelligent attack vectors. Second, this research proposes and develops a new Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) framework by creating correlation dependency nodes among DER control message parameters to understand the risks of intelligent attack vectors better while monitoring and mitigating their impact on smart grid operations. In particular, by leveraging the customized BBN, the system can observe and analyze the uncertain behaviors in DER operations that GenAI introduces, and the proposed framework can help mitigate grid vulnerabilities by understanding the poisonous parameters through mutual information. Finally, the experiment results show that the Autoencoder outperformed GAN in reproducing intelligent attacks with an MSE about 98.984% lower than that of GANs. Additionally, BBN can explain prominent parameters of the intelligent attacks’ by quantifying dependencies through mutual information.","Munir, Md Shirajum; Proddatoori, Sravanthi; Muralidhara, Manjushree; Shetty, Sachin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICNC64010.2025.10993907,4be7trtnnb,,,,"2025 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), 2025 International Conference on",,173,168,,True,20250217,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Signal Processing and Analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Autoencoders; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Vectors; Data models; Smart grids; Distributed power generation; Bayes methods; Mutual information; Load modeling; Intelligent Cyber Attack; GAN; Autoencoder; Bayesian Belief Networks; Cyber Risk",A Bayesian Belief Network Framework for Protecting Generative AI-driven Attack in Smart Grid Communication,

"Ensuring end-to-end cross-layer communication security in military networks by selecting covert schemes between nodes is a key solution for military communication security. With the development of communication technology, covert communication has expanded from the physical layer to the network and application layers, utilizing methods such as artificial noise, private networks, and semantic coding to transmit secret messages. However, as adversaries continuously eavesdrop on specific communication channels, the accumulation of sufficient data may reveal underlying patterns that influence concealment, and establishing a cross-layer covert communication mechanism emerges as an effective strategy to mitigate these regulatory challenges. In this article, we first survey the communication security solution based on covert communication, specifically targeting three typical scenarios: device-to-device, private network, and public network communication, and analyze their application scopes.

"Generative AI poses deep questions for copyright law because it defies the assumptions behind existing legal frameworks. 'The tension surfaces most clearly in debates overfair use, where established tests falter in the face of generative systems' distinctive features. This Article takes up the fair-use question to expose copyright's limitations as well as its latent commitments, particularly its allowances for the exploitation of non-authorial value. Fair use's transformative use paradigm, which compares the purpose of the use with that of the original work, faces difficulty evaluating copying during the training of AI models. Close examination of the technology-from training through the operation of completed systems-reveals that the purpose of copying may be contingent because a model's capabilities and ultimate uses are indeterminate at the time of training. This hurdle can be sidestepped by recognizing that purpose serves as a proxy for determining whether the use intrudes on markets rightly belonging to the copyright owner. However, this raises the question of which markets those are. Answering the market question requires delving into copyright's latent space-the unarticulated principles and commitments embedded in its jurisprudence. This Article identifies a dividing line between market value that stems from an author's creative choices and market value that does not, with courts permitting users to tap into the latter even to the copyright owner's detriment. 'The reoriented test would ask whether a user exploits non-authorial value like that which stems from facts, tropes, and third-party investment versus the authorial value arising from an artist's creative decisions. The precise line remains to be hashed out--courts have historically drawn the line differently across creative fields to balance copyright's competing objectives in specific contexts. The fair-use question also reveals deeper structural limitations of the copyright regime. Concretely, the argument that copyright's pro-artist policies compel denial of-fair use misses that AI systems trained on licensed works may still displace human creators. The lack of unauthorized use takes the problem outside copyright's domain. The core problem is not the duplication of specific works, but the ability to produce comparable works cheaply and quickly. The challenge cannot be resolved through the mere extension or denial of fair use. Instead, it demands we put copyright in dialogue with other regimes for promoting the arts, blunting the misuse of these tools, and confronting the technology's capacity to consolidate power,","Ard, B.

"this study explores the factors influencing the adoption of Generative AI in the creative industry, focusing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) factors: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, and consumer-based brand equity factors: brand recognition and brand trust. While previous research has emphasized the importance of UTAUT constructs in technology adoption, the influence of brand equity factors remains underexplored. This study bridges this gap and provides insights to enhance adoption strategies. Standardized questionnaires were used, incorporating UTAUT constructs and brand-related variables such as Brand Recognition and Brand Trust. A sample of 208 creative professionals from the US and Spain validated the proposed model using PLS-SEM. Results reveal that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and brand trust positively influence the behavioral intention to use Generative AI tools, while brand recognition negatively influences behavioral intention. Social influence and effort expectancy did not present statistically significant results. The model explains 67 % of the variance in behavioral intention (R² = 0.679), indicating strong predictive power. These insights contribute to developing effective adoption strategies for Generative AI in the creative industry.","Weglarz, Dominika; Pla-Garcia, Cintia; Isabel Jiménez-Zarco, Ana",Business Source Ultimate,,10.17163/ret.n29.2025.01,5dbkqdyjbv,,,29,"Retos, Revista de Ciencias Administrativas y Económicas",,27,9,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=5dbkqdyjbv&recordId=5dbkqdyjbv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Universidad Politecnica Salesiana,Brand identification; Brand loyalty; Innovation adoption; Brand equity; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Statistical significance,"Aceptación de la Inteligencia Artificial Generativa en la industria creativa: el rol del modelo UTAUT, reconocimiento y la confianza de marca en su adopción.",15
"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is continuously transforming the creative industries in the Philippines, particularly in advertising agencies, by generating creative content based on user input. This study explores how GAI impacts creativity in these agencies, focusing on two key areas: the dimensions of creativity (novelty, affectivity, utility, and humor) and the stages of the creative process (preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification). The research aims to understand how GAI can shape the creative workforce in advertising agencies, enhancing rather than replacing human creativity while supporting SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. As GAI becomes more integrated into the day-to-day workflows, its influence on idea collaboration and generation is the key area of the study. The researchers used the Partial Least Squares – Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and WARP-PLS to analyze the survey data from the insights of industry professionals who use GAI in their creative output. Contrary to the previous research on how GAI shapes the creative process until the verification stage, the study found insufficient support for GAI’s influence on the verification stage of the creative output. GAI does not fundamentally redefine creativity in advertising but instead serves as a tool that streamlines processes and improves certain aspects of ideation. This indicates that the relationship between GAI and creative output is not direct, leading to a new emerging model that explains how the dimensions of creativity mediate the relationship on how GAI influences the creative output of advertising agencies in every stage of the creative process.","Gonzales, Maria Scherry Mei P.; Matawaran, Sophia Nicole T.; Pascua, Mary Christ E.; Pesueña, Rafael Luis C.; Etrata Jr., Antonio E.",Business Source Ultimate,,10.20525/ijrbs.v14i3.4115,f72ayfdvgr,,,3,International Journal of Research in Business &amp; Social Science,,368,360,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=f72ayfdvgr&recordId=f72ayfdvgr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250501,Center for Strategic Studies in Business &amp; Finance,"Creativity in advertising; Advertising agencies; Cultural industries; Advertising Agencies; Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events with Facilities; Cable and Other Subscription Programming; Television Broadcasting; Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events without Facilities; Agents and Managers for Artists, Athletes, Entertainers, and Other Public Figures; Independent Artists, Writers, and Performers; Book Publishers; Motion Picture and Video Production; Motion Picture and Video Distribution; Motion Picture Theaters (except Drive-Ins); Drive-In Motion Picture Theaters; Other Motion Picture and Video Industries; Record Production; Integrated Record Production/Distribution; Music Publishers; Sound Recording Studios; Other Sound Recording Industries; Radio Networks; Radio Stations; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Structural equation modeling",Dimensions of Creativity as a Mediator Between Generative Artificial Intelligence and Creative Output in the Philippine Advertising Agencies.,14

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping advertising, communication and media agencies, enhancing operational efficiency and creativity. These agencies, central to the media business and brand management across all industries, have transitioned from their traditional roles to digital marketing consultants, with AI significantly influencing this evolution in co-creating value. At the same time, AI also bears the risk of co-destruction. This paper examines AI's current deployment, and its potential future impact based on a survey of 108 decision-makers from German agencies. Results show varied AI adoption across different types of agencies and specific aspects of the overall value creation process, while the orchestration of AI deployment still appears to be in an experimental stage.

"This study assessed the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) usage on the academic outcomes of engineering students within the context of Yemen's unique socioeconomic challenges. This study employed a quantitative approach through a structured 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire, which was distributed to 277 engineering students from Taiz University, Yemen. In a resource-constrained environment, the results exhibited a strong correlation between GenAI usage and engineering students’ overall grades and skills development. Additionally, findings showed that socioeconomic challenges that students face in Yemen have moderately hindered students from the effective usage of GenAI for educational purposes, which is a key finding for higher education institutions (HEIs). Also, statistical results showed that almost all respondents are familiar with GenAI tool usage, while 89.17% use ChatGPT as a fundamental component of learning. Of course, the integration of GenAI into education has become inevitable, compelling HEI policymakers to regulate its use and formally adopt it as a primary source of learning systems. Students and educators should obtain continuous training to effectively benefit from GenAI while conforming to ethics and boosting their intellectual capabilities and skills. Raised concerns that the students overreliance on AI tools could undermine their problem-solving abilities and practical skills development while complicating students’ evaluation process for educators. The outcomes of this study could serve as a foundational reference for policymakers, educators, and students in Yemen and similar settings.

"DIALOGUE (DIagnostic AI Learning through Objective Guided User Experience) is a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based training program designed to enhance diagnostic communication skills in medical students. In this single-arm pre–post study, we evaluated whether DIALOGUE could improve students' ability to disclose a type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosis with clarity, structure, and empathy. Thirty clinical-phase students completed two pre-test virtual encounters with an AI-simulated patient (ChatGPT, GPT-4o), scored by blinded raters using an eight-domain rubric. Participants then engaged in ten asynchronous GenAI scenarios with automated natural-language feedback. Seven days later, they completed two post-test consultations with human standardized patients, again evaluated with the same rubric. Mean total performance increased by 36.7 points (95% CI: 31.4–42.1; p &lt; 0.001), and the proportion of high-performing students rose from 0% to 70%. Gains were significant across all domains, most notably in opening the encounter, closure, and diabetes specific explanation. Multiple regression showed that lower baseline empathy (β = −0.41, p = 0.005) and higher digital self-efficacy (β = 0.35, p = 0.016) independently predicted greater improvement; gender had only a marginal effect. Cluster analysis revealed three learner profiles, with the highest-gain group characterized by low empathy and high digital self-efficacy. Inter-rater reliability was excellent (ICC ≈ 0.90).

"With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI), its potential applications in higher education have attracted significant attention. This study investigated how 148 students from diverse engineering disciplines and regions across China used generative AI, focusing on its impact on their learning experience and the opportunities and challenges it poses in engineering education. Based on the surveyed data, we explored four key areas: the frequency and application scenarios of AI use among engineering students, its impact on students' learning and performance, commonly encountered challenges in using generative AI, and future prospects for its adoption in engineering education. The results showed that more than half of the participants reported a positive impact of generative AI on their learning efficiency, initiative, and creativity, with nearly half believing it also enhanced their independent thinking. However, despite acknowledging improved study efficiency, many felt their actual academic performance remained largely unchanged and expressed concerns about the accuracy and domain-specific reliability of generative AI.

"Background: The rapid integration of generative AIs, such as ChatGPT, into industrial, process, and construction management introduces both operational advantages and emerging cognitive risks. While these models support task automation and safety analysis, their internal architecture differs fundamentally from human cognition, posing interpretability and trust challenges in high-risk contexts. Methods: This study investigates whether architectural design elements in Transformer-based generative models contribute to a measurable divergence from human reasoning. A methodological framework is developed to examine core AI mechanisms—vectorization, positional encoding, attention scoring, and optimization functions—focusing on how these introduce quantifiable ""distances"" from human semantic understanding. Results: Through theoretical analysis and a case study involving fall prevention advice in construction, six types of architectural distances are identified and evaluated using cosine similarity and attention mapping. The results reveal misalignments in focus, semantics, and response stability, which may hinder effective human–AI collaboration in safety-critical decisions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that such distances represent not only algorithmic abstraction but also potential safety risks when generative AI is deployed in practice. The study advocates for the development of AI architectures that better reflect human cognitive structures to reduce these risks and improve reliability in safety applications.","Wen, He; Hu, Pingfan",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/ai6070138,g3gtuxhtef,,,7,<mark>AI</mark>,,,138,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=g3gtuxhtef&recordId=g3gtuxhtef&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Transformer models; Industrial safety; Accidental fall prevention; Cognition; Risk perception,Architectural Gaps in Generative AI: Quantifying Cognitive Risks for Safety Applications.,6
"Transformer-based generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models achieve remarkable results in a wide range of fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. However, this comes at the cost of increased complexity and the need of sophisticated non-linearities such as softmax and GELU. Even if Transformers are computationally dominated by matrix multiplications (MatMul), these non-linearities can become a performance bottleneck, especially if dedicated hardware is used to accelerate MatMul operators. In this work, we introduce a GenAI BFloat16 Transformer acceleration template based on a heterogeneous tightly-coupled cluster containing 256KiB of shared SRAM, 8 general-purpose RISC-V cores, a $24\times 8$ systolic array MatMul accelerator, and a novel accelerator for Transformer softmax, GELU and SiLU non-linearities: SoftEx. SoftEx introduces an approximate exponentiation algorithm balancing efficiency ( $121\times $ speedup over glibc’s implementation) with accuracy (mean relative error of 0.14%). In 12 nm technology, SoftEx occupies 0.039 mm 2 , only 3.22% of the cluster, which achieves an operating frequency of 1.12 GHz. Compared to optimized software running on the RISC-V cores, SoftEx achieves significant improvements, accelerating softmax and GELU computations by up to $10.8\times $ and $5.11\times $ , respectively, while reducing their energy consumption by up to $10.8\times $ and $5.29\times $ . These enhancements translate into a $1.58\times $ increase in throughput (310 GOPS at 0.8 V) and a $1.42\times $ improvement in energy efficiency (1.34 TOPS/W at 0.55 V) on end-to-end ViT inference workloads.","Belano, A.; Tortorella, Y.; Garofalo, A.; Benini, L.; Rossi, D.; Conti, F.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JETCAS.2025.3562734,t2yd54r7mr,,,2,"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, IEEE Journal on, IEEE J.

"In the decade, artificial intelligence has achieved great popularity and applications in medicine and healthcare. Various AI-based algorithms have shown astonishing performance. However, in various data-driven smart healthcare algorithms, the problem of incomplete dataset remains a huge challenge. In this paper, we propose a data completeness enhancement algorithm based on generative AI (i.e., GenAI-DAA) to solve the problems of the in-sufficient data for model training, the data imbalance, and the biases of the training samples. We first construct the cognitive field of the generative models and effectively understand the state of incomplete cognition in generative models. Secondly, on this basis, we propose a quest algorithm for abnormal samples in the cognitive field based on local outlier factor. By fine-grained value evaluation, abnormal samples are given more refined attention. Finally, integrating the above process through multiple cognitive adjustments, GenAI-DAA gradually improves the cognitive ability. GenAI-DAA can be summarized as “Quest $ \longrightarrow$ Estimate$ \longrightarrow$Tune-up”.

"The implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has the potential to unleash the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). However, integrating GAI with IoT introduces a significant challenge in managing the limited resources of edge networks. In this article, we propose a resource optimization framework for GAI in IoT systems to address this issue, leveraging a heterogeneous computing framework. We focus on the system utility maximization problem, which jointly optimizes transmit power, heterogeneous computing allocation, CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and task scheduling under the latency constraint. The optimal CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and computing allocation are obtained by employing data parallelism analysis. In particular, we develop a hierarchical soft actor-critic with an intrinsic curiosity (HSAC-IC) algorithm to determine the task scheduling strategy. The HSAC-IC algorithm utilizes a hierarchical strategy structure and an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) to improve learning efficiency and performance, particularly in environments characterized by sparse rewards, high-dimensional action spaces, and complex tasks. Our simulations benchmark the HSAC-IC algorithm against two existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and three reference schemes. The results illustrate that our scheme significantly outperforms these alternatives, ensuring AIGC user service requirements, while minimizing service generation costs, and optimizing resource allocation by configuring the image quality strategy on edge servers.","Feng, J.; Huang, X.; Liu, L.; Yang, M.; Pei, Q.; Shee, Y.G.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2025.3542473,ibqk44ji7f,,,10,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,13247,13233,,True,20250515,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Resource management; Internet of Things; Computational modeling; Servers; Radio spectrum management; Optimization; Image edge detection; Graphics processing units; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Energy consumption; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (GAI); hierarchical soft actor-critic with an intrinsic curiosity (HSAC-IC); Internet of Things (IoT); resource optimization",Resource Allocation for Task-Oriented Generative Artificial Intelligence in Internet of Things,12
"The integration of federated learning (FL) with the Internet of Things (IoT) represents an advanced technological trend, combining the extensive connectivity of IoT with the powerful processing capabilities of FL to drive innovation and optimization across multiple domains. Given the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the variability in data distribution, developing strategies to enhance FL performance without overly burdening resource-constrained devices is crucial. This article proposes an FL algorithm based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) for IoT devices with extreme heterogeneity in data and resources. The algorithm utilizes pretrained GAI models to generate new data, aligning the data distributions of individual IoT devices closer to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thereby effectively reducing the heterogeneity of local data. Additionally, the proposed algorithm incorporates data synthesis and resource scheduling strategies to mitigate the heterogeneity of local device resources. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while maximizing FL performance. Experimental results demonstrate that, under significant resource and data distribution disparities, most existing solutions struggle to converge, whereas the proposed method converges and achieves superior performance.

"Semantic Communication (SC) is an emerging technology aiming to surpass the Shannon limit. Traditional SC strategies often minimize signal distortion between the original and reconstructed data, neglecting perceptual quality, especially in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Generative AI Semantic Communication (GSC) system for single-user scenarios. This system leverages deep generative models to establish a new paradigm in SC. Specifically, At the transmitter end, it employs a joint source-channel coding mechanism based on the Swin Transformer for efficient semantic feature extraction and compression. At the receiver end, an advanced Diffusion Model (DM) reconstructs high-quality images from degraded signals, enhancing perceptual details. Additionally, we present a Multi-User Generative Semantic Communication (MU-GSC) system utilizing an asynchronous processing model. This model effectively manages multiple user requests and optimally utilizes system resources for parallel processing. Simulation results on public datasets demonstrate that our generative AI semantic communication systems achieve superior transmission efficiency and enhanced communication content quality across various channel conditions. Compared to CNN-based DeepJSCC, our methods improve the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 17.75% in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and by 20.84% in Rayleigh channels.","Zhang, K.; Li, L.; Lin, W.; Yan, Y.; Li, R.; Cheng, W.; Han, Z.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2025.3526839,uhhtwe5cvf,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) in edge networks has excelled in delivering human-level creative services close to the end users. However, providing customized intelligence services to a wide range of end clients remains challenging due to the diverse demands of edge applications. In this paper, we present FlexGen, an efficient generative AI framework with flexible diffusion models, to tailor the intelligence service for different client-side requests under diverse quality and efficiency constraints. To this end, we first design and train a flexible diffusion model to support quality-and-cost adjustable image synthesis. After that, we focus on the server-side energy minimization problem subject to the quality level of generative service and the client-side latency constraint. We further theoretically characterize the relationship between the width of the diffusion model and the expected quality of the synthetic image. Following that, the decomposition solution is applied to optimize the generative service, where the image synthesis strategy and resource allocation policy are personalized for different client-side requests. Experiments indicate that, compared to existing image generation schemes, our framework can save up to two times energy consumption without sacrificing the quality of the service.","Li, P.; Dong, H.; Qian, L.; Zhou, S.; Wu, Y.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2024.3522084,qzf4kkf4kj,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Radio map is an efficient demonstration for visually displaying the wireless signal coverage within a certain region. It has been considered to be increasingly helpful for the future sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, as wireless nodes are becoming more crowded and complicated. However, the construction of high resolution radio map is very challenging due to the sparse sampling in practical systems. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable to create synthetic data to fill in gaps in real-world measurements, is an effective technique to construct high precision radio maps. Currently, generative models for radio map construction are trained with two-dimension (2D) single band radio maps in urban scenario, which has poor generalization in diverse terrain scenarios, spectrum bands, and heights. To tackle this problem, we provide a multiband three-dimension (3D) radio map dataset with consideration of terrain and climate information, named SpectrumNet. It is the largest radio map dataset in terms of dimensions and scale, which contains the radio map of 3 spacial dimensions, 5 frequency bands, 11 terrain scenarios, and 3 climate scenarios. We introduce the parameters and settings for the SpectrumNet dataset generation, and evaluate four baseline methods for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset. Experiments show the necessity of the SpectrumNet dataset for training models with strong generalization in spacial, frequency, and terrain scenario domains. Future works on the SpectrumNet dataset are also discussed, including the dataset expansion and calibration, as well as the extended studies on generative models for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset.","Zhang, S.; Jiang, S.; Lin, W.; Fang, Z.; Liu, K.; Zhang, H.; Chen, K.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2024.3502492,w2orwume7r,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly driving a new phase of artificial intelligence revolution, marked by various applications such as ChatGPT, Sora and DeepSeek. With powerful capabilities in content generation, personalization and user interaction, GenAI can drive significant enhancements in various mobile services to satisfy individual user preferences. Meanwhile, mobile services offer substantial support for accessibility, functionality and intelligence of GenAI applications. However, current research on integrating GenAI and mobile services remains nascent, lacking necessary theoretical and technical support. In this survey, we break down a new vision to guide research on integrating GenAI and mobile services, aiming to improve 6G intelligence levels and enable 6G mobile networks to support the integration of GenAI and mobile services effectively. We begin by examining the necessity of integrating GenAI with 6G mobile services and exploring potential learning architectures of GenAI models within mobile networks. Next, we analyze potential solutions from two perspectives: how 6G mobile networks empower GenAI and how GenAI enables mobile services. We subsequently explore a promising use case, along with essential features and techniques, to facilitate the integration of GenAI and mobile services.

"As a form of artificial intelligence (AI) technology based on interactive learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely applied across various fields and has achieved remarkable accomplishments. However, DRL faces certain limitations, including low sample efficiency and poor generalization. Therefore, in this article, we show how to leverage generative AI (GAI) to address these issues and enhance the performance of DRL algorithms. We first introduce several classic GAI and DRL algorithms and demonstrate the applications of GAI-enhanced DRL algorithms. Then, we discuss how to use GAI to improve DRL algorithms from the data and policy perspectives. Subsequently, we introduce a framework that demonstrates an actual and novel integration of GAI with DRL, that is, GAI-enhanced DRL. Additionally, we provide a case study of the framework for UAV-assisted integrated near-field/far-field communication to validate the performance of the proposed framework.

"The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the deployment of edge computing infrastructures have significantly advanced data processing and network communications. Federated Learning (FL), leveraging these developments, offers a decentralized approach to learning across edge devices while preserving local privacy. However, traditional FL paradigms encounter challenges related to non-IID data distributions, diverse computational capabilities of edge devices, and multimodal tasks. This paper proposes a novel Dual-Circulation Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) framework for Clustered Federated Learning (GAI-CFL), designed to address multi-granularity heterogeneity including data, resources, and task heterogeneity. The GAI-CFL framework integrates Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies to optimize data generation and resource allocation processes. GAI techniques are employed to reduce intra-cluster data heterogeneity by generating data, thereby enriching local datasets and enhancing model convergence. To address inter-cluster data and task heterogeneity, a dual-circulation optimization strategy is implemented, utilizing RL with GDMs to generate optimal strategies based on input data characteristics dynamically. Additionally, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach is incorporated within GDMs to select the best expert models for denoising steps, ensuring efficient data generation strategies. Comprehensive simulations clarify that the proposed GAI-CFL framework significantly presents benchmark schemes, achieving lower energy consumption and enhanced system performance under the same delay and performance constraints.","He, W.; Yao, H.; Ren, X.; Ouyang, T.; Xiong, Z.; He, Y.; Liu, Y.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2025.3542862,hmamecqdxj,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"With the rising availability and support of geospatial data and tools, geospatial data analysis is increasing rapidly. However, geospatial data is challenging to extract and understand by individuals with limited or no prior knowledge of handling such data. This study presents a novel platform that integrates generative artificial intelligence (Gen. AI) and prompt engineering techniques for geospatial data retrieval and analysis. This is achieved by firing natural language queries and integrating a generative pre-trained transformer GPT-3.5 for data retrieval and analysis. The platform translates unstructured natural language inputs into structured Overpass API queries, retrieving detailed geospatial data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The system streamlines the process, from query to visualization, enabling users without technical geospatial expertise to access spatial information seamlessly. It supports geospatial data retrieval tasks such as Point of Interest (PoI) extraction, proximity queries, and attribute-based retrieval. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing tools such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), GeoGPT, GeoInsight, MapQA, OSM-GPT with an average query-execution time of 17.3 seconds and an average accuracy of 95%. It shows a significant improvement in usability over manual Overpass query construction. The proposed framework achieves higher performance while maintaining a lightweight design that does not require model fine-tuning or external training data. Unlike existing tools that heavily rely on fine-tuned transformers with tightly coupled components, the proposed framework is modular, prompt-driven, and API-based, which enables its rapid deployment and minimal resource usage. This lightweight architecture helps to improve system maintainability, scalability, and makes it easily accessible for real-time applications and end-users with limited technical infrastructure. Overall, the framework offers a scalable, accessible, and extensible solution for spatial data querying in open-source GIS workflows. This study can transform conventional geospatial data analysis practices into a more inclusive and user-friendly approach that features a geointelligent environment.","Vohra, M. A.; Singh, T.

"This paper reports on a design-based research (DBR) study that aims to devise an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered teachable agent that supports secondary school students' learning-by-teaching practices of mathematics learning content. A long-standing pedagogical practice of learning-by-teaching is powered by a recent advancement of generative AI technologies, yielding our teachable agent called ""ALTER-Math."" This study chronicles one usability testing and three cycles of iterative design and implementation process of ""ALTER-Math."" The three empirical studies involved a total of 320 middle school students and six teachers in authentic classroom settings. The first study was exploratory, focusing on the qualitative feedback from the students and teachers through open-ended surveys, interviews and classroom observations. The second study yielded a medium-high (M = 3.26) quantitative survey result on students' perceived engagement and usability on top of the qualitative findings. Finally, the final study included pre- and post-knowledge tests in a quasi-experimental study design as well as student and teacher interviews.

"This study explores the role of generative AI (GenAI) in providing formative feedback in children's digital learning experiences, specifically in the context of mathematics education. Using multimodal data, the research compares AI-generated feedback with feedback from human instructors, focusing on its impact on children's learning outcomes. Children engaged with a digital body-scale number line to learn addition and subtraction of positive and negative integers through embodied interaction. The study followed a between-group design, with one group receiving feedback from a human instructor and the other from GenAI. Eye-tracking data and system logs were used to evaluate student's information processing behaviour and cognitive load. The results revealed that while task-based performance did not differ significantly between conditions, the GenAI feedback condition demonstrated lower cognitive load and students show different visual information processing strategies among the two conditions. The findings provide empirical support for the potential of GenAI to complement traditional teaching by providing structured and adaptive feedback that supports efficient learning. The study underscores the importance of hybrid intelligence approaches that integrate human and AI feedback to enhance learning through synergistic feedback.

"Although current generative AI (GenAI) enables designers to create novel images, its focus on text-based and whole-image interaction limits expressive engagement with visual materials. Based on the design concept of deconstruction and reconstruction of digital visual attributes for visual prompts, we present FusAIn, a GenAI prompt composition tool that lets designers create personalized pens by loading them with objects or attributes such as color or texture. GenAI then fuses the pen’s contents to create new images. Extracting and reusing inspirational material matches designers’ existing work practices, making GenAI more contextualized for professional design. A study with 12 designers shows how FusAIn improves their ability to define visual details at different levels that are difficult to express with current GenAI prompts. Pen-based interaction lets them maintain fine-grained control over generated results, increasing GenAI image’s editability and reusability.

"Flipped classroom pedagogy, primarily focused on in-person classroom settings, emphasizes pre-class independent learning where students engage asynchronously with online materials and self-assessments. However, traditional pre-class learning methods, such as watching pre-recorded instructional videos and completing multiple-choice self-assessments, often fail to prepare students for in-person peer debates, which are crucial in business ethics education for developing higher-order thinking and ethical reasoning. This study addresses this issue by developing a generative AI learning companion system tailored for an asynchronous business ethics course. The system enables students to practice ethical debates with AI partners during the pre-class phase, improving their readiness and confidence for in-person peer debates. We implemented this system with sixty-two third-year students from a national university in Taiwan, divided into experimental and control groups. Our findings demonstrate that the AI-supported debate method significantly enhanced students' pre-class preparation and ethical learning confidence without increasing their autonomous learning task load. This approach offers a novel solution for flipped classroom pedagogy, particularly in courses requiring intensive peer interaction such as business ethics.",Yung-Hsiang Hu,ERIC,,10.1007/s10639-025-13379-x,hu25buqqen,,,10,Education and Information Technologies,,14391,14367,,True,20250701,,Asynchronous Communication; Learning Processes; Flipped Classroom; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Business; Ethics; Business Education; Debate; Man Machine Systems; College Students; Foreign Countries; Computer Mediated Communication; Taiwan,Advancing Asynchronous Pre-Class Learning in Flipped Classrooms: Generative AI Companions in Business Ethics,30
"The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into higher education is transforming students' learning processes, academic performance, and psychological well-being. Despite the increasing adoption of GAI tools, the mechanisms through which students' AI literacy and self-regulated learning (SRL) relate to their academic and emotional experiences remain underexplored. This study investigates how AI literacy and SRL are associated with writing performance and digital well-being among university students in GAI-supported higher learning contexts. A survey was administered to 257 students from universities in China, and structural equation modeling was used to examine the hypothesized relationships. Results show that both AI literacy and SRL significantly and positively predict students' writing performance, with SRL having a stronger effect. Moreover, AI literacy shows a positive association with GAI-driven well-being, with writing performance serving as a partial mediator in this relationship. These findings suggest that fostering both technological competencies and effective learning strategies may support students' academic outcomes while supporting their psychological well-being in AI-enriched educational environments. By integrating AI literacy and SRL into a unified model, this study contributes to the growing body of research on GAI-driven well-being in higher education and offers practical implications for cultivating balanced and sustainable learning experiences in the age of GAI.","Shi, Jiajia; Liu, Weitong; Hu, Ke",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/bs15050705,2uznpzqhev,,,5,Behavioral Sciences (2076-328X),,,705,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=2uznpzqhev&recordId=2uznpzqhev&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250501,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Self-regulated learning; Psychological well-being; Learning; Structural equation modeling,Exploring How AI Literacy and Self-Regulated Learning Relate to Student Writing Performance and Well-Being in Generative AI-Supported Higher Education.,15
"As generative AI services become increasingly integrated into consumer decision making, concerns have grown regarding their influence on consumer autonomy—the extent to which individuals retain independent control over AI-assisted decisions. Although these services offer efficiency and convenience, they can simultaneously constrain consumer decision making, potentially impacting trust, satisfaction, and usage intention. This study investigates the role of perceived consumer autonomy in shaping consumer responses, specifically examining how task difficulty (Study 1) and AI service design elements—explainability, feedback, and shared responsibility (Study 2)—influence autonomy perceptions and subsequent consumer outcomes. Using two scenario-based experiments involving a total of 708 participants, the results reveal that perceived autonomy significantly enhances consumer trust, particularly in contexts involving high task difficulty. Among the tested AI design interventions, shared responsibility emerged as most effective in enhancing perceived autonomy, trust, satisfaction, and long-term engagement, whereas explainability and feedback alone showed limited impact. These findings underscore the importance of designing AI services that actively support consumer agency through user-involved decision-making frameworks rather than relying solely on passive informational transparency. Theoretical implications for consumer autonomy in AI interactions are discussed, along with practical recommendations for designing consumer-centered AI services.","Han, Jihyung; Ko, Daekyun",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/bs15040534,hw3cplwfrv,,,4,Behavioral Sciences (2076-328X),,,534,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=hw3cplwfrv&recordId=hw3cplwfrv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,MDPI,Consumer behavior; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Trust; Satisfaction,"Consumer Autonomy in Generative AI Services: The Role of Task Difficulty and AI Design Elements in Enhancing Trust, Satisfaction, and Usage Intention.",15
